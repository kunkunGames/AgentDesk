# Kakao scheduled-message delivery

AgentDesk can deliver an opted-in scheduled message to Discord, up to five
Kakao friends, and the connected Kakao account's **My Chatroom**. Kakao support
is disabled by default and reads secrets only from process environment
variables; tokens are never accepted through the dashboard or serialized into
runtime configuration responses.

## Kakao application prerequisites

Create a Kakao Developers application and configure Kakao Login. Friend sends
also require Kakao's separate message-send permission. The user token must have:

- `talk_message` for My Chatroom and friend sends
- `friends` for selecting or resolving eligible friends

Kakao restricts friend delivery to users of the same service, permits at most
five recipients per request, and applies provider quotas. See the official
[Kakao Talk message REST API](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/ko/kakaotalk-message/rest-api)
and [Kakao Login token API](https://developers.kakao.com/docs/ko/kakaologin/rest-api).

An application REST API key alone cannot send a message. AgentDesk also needs
either a user refresh token (recommended) or a currently valid user access
token obtained after the required consent.

## Enable one account

Restart AgentDesk after setting the environment:

```bash
AGENTDESK_KAKAO_ENABLED=true
AGENTDESK_KAKAO_LANDING_URL=https://agentdesk.example.com/messages

KAKAO_REST_API_KEY=your-rest-api-key
KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
KAKAO_REFRESH_TOKEN=the-user-refresh-token
```

`KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET` is optional when the Kakao application does not require
one. `KAKAO_ACCESS_TOKEN` can be supplied as a short-lived fallback. When a
refresh token is present, AgentDesk refreshes once before the first send and
keeps rotated access/refresh tokens only in process memory.

## Enable multiple accounts

Account IDs use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens. The `default` account
keeps the unqualified `KAKAO_*` names; other accounts use an uppercase prefix:

```bash
AGENTDESK_KAKAO_ACCOUNTS=default,work-bot
AGENTDESK_KAKAO_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=default

KAKAO_WORK_BOT_REST_API_KEY=your-work-app-key
KAKAO_WORK_BOT_CLIENT_SECRET=your-work-client-secret
KAKAO_WORK_BOT_REFRESH_TOKEN=the-work-user-refresh-token
```

This explicit allowlist prevents a request from selecting an arbitrary
environment-variable prefix.

## Delivery safety

- Provider URLs are fixed in code; configuration cannot redirect tokens.
- HTTP redirects are disabled and requests have a 10-second timeout.
- Linked landing/image URLs must be public HTTPS URLs without credentials or a
  custom port.
- Message text is limited to 200 characters and friend UUIDs to five unique,
  printable identifiers.
- A transport failure or malformed success response is treated as an ambiguous
  outcome. The durable external-delivery outbox does not automatically replay
  an ambiguous Kakao send, avoiding duplicate messages.
- Logs and API errors report counts/status only, never tokens or friend UUIDs.

## Schedule Discord, friends, and My Chatroom together

Use the existing protected scheduled-message endpoint. `targetChannelId` is
optional when Kakao is the only target; include it to fan out to Discord in the
same fire transaction.

```json
{
  "content": "오후 3시 배포 점검입니다.",
  "targetChannelId": "1492021444308238487",
  "providerTargets": {
    "kakao": {
      "accountId": "default",
      "friendUuids": ["eligible-kakao-friend-uuid"],
      "sendToSelf": true,
      "imageUrl": "https://cdn.example.com/deploy-card.jpg",
      "confirmed": true
    }
  },
  "scheduledAt": "2026-09-01T15:00:00+09:00"
}
```

Omit `friendUuids` for self-only delivery, or set `sendToSelf` to `false` for
friend-only delivery. At least one Kakao audience is required. API responses
return the account, mode, and recipient count, but never return friend UUIDs.
Active reservations and pending outbox rows retain the validated UUIDs under
the same PostgreSQL access boundary; terminal transitions scrub those payloads.

The delivery history exposes independent `friends` and `self` status entries.
If a runner disappears after the provider-dispatch fence, the result becomes
`unknown` and is not replayed automatically, preventing duplicate messages.
