# Agent Maintenance Index

> Purpose: when an agent is asked to change AgentDesk, this directory tells it
> *where* the canonical surface is, *what* is mid-migration, and *what is
> intentionally legacy and must not absorb new logic*. It complements
> [`docs/source-of-truth.md`](../source-of-truth.md) (which answers "which
> file do I edit?" for runtime/config) by answering "which Rust module do I
> edit?" for code.
>
> Created per #1279. Update cadence: each PR that finishes a migration milestone
> or introduces a new mid-migration surface must update the relevant page in
> the same PR. The full table re-audit is run quarterly against the generated
> inventories below.

## Pages

- [`change-surfaces.md`](change-surfaces.md) — change-allowed surfaces, with
  canonical modules, giant-file flags, and `do_not_edit_without_migration_plan`
  list. Use this before adding logic to any new file.
- [`discord-outbound-migration.md`](discord-outbound-migration.md) — five
  production callsite families for Discord outbound (#1006). Each row marks
  `migrated | legacy | unknown`. New sends MUST use the v3 outbound; legacy
  bugfixes are permitted only on rows still flagged legacy.
- [`known-legacy.md`](known-legacy.md) — code paths that intentionally remain
  legacy, with the cleanup-owner issue number. Touch them only inside the
  scope of the listed issue or for narrow bugfix.
- [`opencode-usability-spec.md`](opencode-usability-spec.md) — implementation
  contract for raising OpenCode's Discord-facing usability toward Claude/Codex
  parity, including prompt/output safety, SSE text handling, and MCP sync.

## Generated Companions (read-only)

- [`docs/generated/module-inventory.md`](../generated/module-inventory.md) —
  every Rust module with line count and giant-file flag. Source of truth for
  the giant-file list in `change-surfaces.md`.
- [`docs/generated/route-inventory.md`](../generated/route-inventory.md) — HTTP
  routes and the file/line where each is registered.
- [`docs/generated/worker-inventory.md`](../generated/worker-inventory.md) —
  background workers spawned at startup.
- [`docs/generated/db-file-duplication-audit.md`](../generated/db-file-duplication-audit.md)
  and [`docs/generated/policy-db-inventory.md`](../generated/policy-db-inventory.md)
  — cross-file duplication and policy DB usage.

## Schema (Common to All Pages)

Each row in `change-surfaces.md` and `known-legacy.md`, and each entry in
`discord-outbound-migration.md`, follows the schema below (per static-analysis
report §8). Any field that is not yet known is written as `unknown` rather
than omitted.

- `feature` — short slug (e.g. `discord_outbound`, `policy_engine`).
- `canonical_modules` — Rust module path(s) where new logic for this feature
  belongs.
- `legacy_modules` — modules that previously owned the feature and are being
  drained.
- `do_not_edit_without_migration_plan` — modules that compile and run today
  but are scheduled for replacement; new logic added here will be rolled back.
- `active_callsite_coverage` — for in-flight migrations, the current
  per-callsite status (`migrated | legacy | unknown`).
- `invariants` — properties that must hold across canonical and legacy paths
  during migration.
- `allowed_changes` — `bugfix`, `new_feature`, `extraction`, scoped per row.
- `tests` — the test file(s) that guard the invariants.
- `related_issues` — GitHub issue numbers that own the migration or cleanup.

## Cross-Reference

`docs/source-of-truth.md` lists this directory in its `Deprecated References`
section so that operators looking for the old "which file do I edit?" map find
the code-side companion. When this directory's contract or layout changes,
update the source-of-truth note in the same PR.

## Out-of-Scope (Follow-up Issues)

Per #1279, four additional pages are deferred to follow-up issues to keep this
landing reviewable:

- `pg-only-cleanup.md` — once #1237/#1238/#1239 land.
- `tmux-watcher-lifecycle.md` — depends on #1138 / #964 / #1222.
- `dashboard-read-models.md` — once dashboard read-model split is scoped.
- `policy-engine-guardrails.md` — once policy engine refactor is scoped.

Open a child issue under #1279 to add any of these.
