# Inventory Docs Merge Driver (`regen-inventory`)

> `docs/generated/module-inventory.md` and

> views (#4724). This removes their production-line churn from git merges
> entirely. The `regen-inventory` driver remains only for the two generated

## One-time developer setup (REQUIRED)

A merge-driver assignment in `.gitattributes` is **inert** until the driver
command is registered in your local git config. Run once per clone:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-merge-drivers.sh
```

This is also invoked by `bash scripts/setup-hooks.sh`, so if you already ran the
hooks bootstrap you are covered. Verify with:

```bash
git config --local --get merge.regen-inventory.driver
# → bash scripts/git-merge-regen-inventory.sh %O %A %B %P
```

## What it covers

`.gitattributes` assigns `merge=regen-inventory` to exactly the two generated
files that remain tracked:

- `docs/generated/route-inventory.md`
- `docs/generated/worker-inventory.md`

The generator also emits `module-inventory.md` and `giant-file-registry.md`, but
`.gitignore` keeps those checkout-local. CI generates them before maintenance
checks consume them, so no merge driver is needed for either file.

**Deliberately excluded** (hand-authored, or emitted by a different generator —
the driver would clobber real content): `docs/generated/README.md`,
`db-file-duplication-audit.md`, `maintainability-audit.md` (written by
`audit_maintainability.py`, not the inventory generator), `pg-audit-checklist.md`,
`policy-db-inventory.md`. `ARCHITECTURE.md` is also excluded because it is a
mixed hand-authored + marker-generated file; regenerating it would not resolve a
conflict located in its hand-authored prose.

## How it works (merge-file first, regenerate only on real conflict)

git invokes a custom merge driver whenever **both** sides modify a covered file.
`scripts/git-merge-regen-inventory.sh %O %A %B %P`:

1. **Tries git's normal line-level 3-way merge** (`git merge-file`). When the two
   sides changed **different** rows (independent modules), this merges cleanly
   and the result is byte-identical to what git would have produced without the
   driver — so independent inventory edits are **never** regressed.
2. **Regenerates only on a genuine conflict.** A doc row collides when both sides
   changed the **same** module (or a shared summary line). On that path the
   driver runs `python3 scripts/generate_inventory_docs.py` and takes its output,
   removing the conflict markers. The regenerated file is written over git's `%A`
   (result) path and the driver exits 0.

This two-step design is deliberate: an unconditional regenerate would be *worse*
than the default merge for the common independent-edit case, because under git's
`ort` strategy a source file changed on only one side is written to the working
tree *after* the driver runs. Delegating independent rows to `git merge-file`
sidesteps that entirely.

### Honest limits (why the driver is best-effort, not authoritative)

The driver is an **ergonomic auto-resolver**, not a correctness oracle. Two
empirically-verified `ort` facts bound what it can guarantee:

- On the **regenerate path**, `ort` does **not** reliably materialize the
  colliding module's merged source into the working tree before invoking the
  driver, so the regenerated counts for that module can be momentarily stale.
- On the **clean-merge path**, in-driver regeneration would be actively harmful,
  so we do **not** self-validate there. Measured directly: for two branches that
  change *different* modules (a correct, independent-row merge), `git merge-file`
  yields the correct `app_state=49`, but a regenerate at driver time yields a
  **stale** `app_state=47` — because the other side's one-sided source change is
  not yet in the working tree. Comparing the two would flag a *correct* merge as
  a mismatch and either fail-closed (re-introducing the conflict the driver
  exists to remove) or overwrite the correct result with the stale one. So the
  clean 3-way result is taken verbatim.

What the driver guarantees is narrow and sufficient: it **never leaves conflict
markers on churn** (eliminating the O(N²) manual-resolution tax), and it **never
emits content that is worse than a bad manual resolution would be today** — any
residual drift it produces is caught by the same CI gate that catches a stale
hand-resolved doc.

**Fail-closed:** if the conflict path's regeneration fails, the driver exits
non-zero, leaving the ordinary conflict in place for a human. It never emits
partially-generated content.

## Correctness backstops (authoritative vs convenience)

- **Authoritative, server-side — generation plus focused tracked diff.**
  `scripts/ci-script-checks.sh` (run by the `Script checks runner` job in
  `.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml`; the required *Script checks* context is
  published separately by its fail-closed result mirror) first runs `python3
  scripts/generate_inventory_docs.py`. Generation hard-fails source-of-truth
  violations such as an unregistered giant or invalid registry metadata. CI
  then runs `git diff --exit-code` for `ARCHITECTURE.md`, route inventory, and
  worker inventory, the three generated outputs that remain tracked.
  `check_agent_maintenance_docs.py` consumes the freshly generated, untracked
  module inventory and keeps frozen-surface membership/threshold checks active.
- **Local convenience — the pre-push hook.** `.githooks/pre-push` regenerates
  inventory docs when `src` changed and blocks/amends before push, so most
  tracked drift never leaves the machine. It is a convenience only: it is
  skippable with `git push --no-verify` and requires
  `core.hooksPath=.githooks` (set by `scripts/setup-hooks.sh`). CI remains the
  correctness authority.

## CI note

CI needs no *driver* registration: `.github/workflows/ci-pr.yml` uses
`actions/checkout@v4` and never performs a local `git merge`, and GitHub's
server-side PR merge / merge-queue does **not** honor custom `.gitattributes`
merge drivers. The driver's value is entirely local (developer rebases/merges).
The server-side gate does not rely on the driver: it regenerates from the merged
source tree, validates inventory invariants, and rejects drift in the remaining
tracked outputs.

## Integration step: who guarantees freshness, and how

This section owns the *merge-time* half of the contract that the sections above
describe from the git-driver side. It is the named alternative guarantee for
per-PR gates that are deliberately pinned to immutable inputs.

### Per-PR verification is base-pinned on purpose

A required PR context verifies the immutable synthetic merge `candidate`
provided by `github.sha`, with the checkout required to equal that SHA.
`scripts/giant_file_progress.py::pr_comparison_base` requires exactly two ordered
parents: the candidate's comparison base first, and the event's exact PR head
second. The event's `pull_request.base.sha` can lag that first parent (as in
#5904/#5905). Equality is accepted directly; a different event base must be an
ancestor of the comparison base. Rewinds, unrelated histories, unavailable
objects and Git errors fail closed. The candidate is trusted as GitHub's event
input; this check does not independently reconstruct its merge tree.

Archives, diffs, frozen-blob checks and debt accounting all use the candidate's
actual first parent, so another PR's intervening changes cannot be credited or
charged to this PR. Evidence preserves the original `event_base_sha` separately
from `comparison_base_sha` / `merge_first_parent`; `base_tree` belongs to the
comparison base. Malformed provenance is rejected before the evaluator archives
or scans inventory, with the observed event and parent IDs retained in failure
evidence. This does not move the evaluator ahead of earlier CI script checks.

No live `origin/main` lookup or fetch participates in this verdict. Moving that
ref later cannot invalidate the same immutable candidate. A different candidate
needs its own verification, and merge-time freshness remains the integrator's
separate responsibility below.

### The freshness guarantee lives at the merge step

There is **no merge queue** on this repository (no ruleset, and no workflow
carries a `merge_group` trigger), so nothing automatically re-verifies a
candidate against the latest `main`. The guarantee is therefore procedural, and
a single orchestrator owns it end to end:

1. **One integrator.** One orchestrator performs integration and merge for the
   batch. Contributors do not self-merge into `main`.
2. **Build the final candidate.** Immediately before merging, run
   `gh pr update-branch` so the PR's candidate sits on top of current `main`.
3. **Re-pass on that candidate.** Merge only after the **required contexts pass
   on that final candidate**. A green run from an earlier candidate is not a
   merge authorization.
4. **A changed candidate voids the previous evidence.** If `main` moves again
   between step 2 and the merge, the candidate is a different artifact: repeat
   steps 2-3. Never carry the previous candidate's CI result forward as
   approval for the new one.
5. **Reuse review; re-review what integration changed.** Source review of a PR
   whose own commits did not change is reused as-is. Re-review is scoped to
   what integration actually altered: conflict resolutions, and any shared
   contract the merge touched (public signature, DB schema, gate semantics,
   generated-doc surface).

### Why "I just checked `main`" is not the guarantee

Reading `main` immediately before merging leaves the entire lookup→merge window
open; another integrator can land in it. What actually closes the race is step
3 — **the re-pass on the final candidate**, which is the artifact being merged —
not how recently `main` was queried. Evidence supports this because
`scripts/giant_file_progress.py` attributes every record to its own candidate
(`merge_sha`, `merge_first_parent`, `head_sha`, `event_base_sha`,
`candidate_tree`), so a stale result cannot be silently read as covering a
newer candidate.
