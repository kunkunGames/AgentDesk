# GitHub Triage Agent Routing

GitHub issue triage uses a deterministic first stage before PMD fallback.

1. If an issue already has an `agent:<id>` label, that explicit label wins.
2. If no explicit agent label exists, `src/github/triage.rs` evaluates the declarative signal table only for newly-created cards or existing cards that are still unassigned.
3. If exactly one owner is matched, the card is assigned to that agent and AgentDesk attempts to write back `agent:<id>` to GitHub after the local assignment succeeds.
4. If no owner matches, or signals point at multiple owners, the card remains unassigned so the existing PMD classification path handles it.

Keyword signals use bounded matching, path signals use exact path substrings, and label signals can match exact GitHub labels. This avoids broad false positives such as `intuitive` matching `tui`.

Current routing signals:

| Signals from title, body, paths, or labels | Agent label |
| --- | --- |
| `dashboard`, `frontend`, `KanbanHeaderSurface`, `dashboard/` | `agent:adk-dashboard` |
| `relay`, `discord`, `tui`, `tmux`, `codex-tui`, `turn_bridge`, `inflight`, `watcher` | `agent:project-agentdesk` |
| `token`, `rate limit`, `rate_limit`, `rate-limit`, `quota`, `usage` | `agent:token-manager` |
| `e2e`, `tui-relay-e2e`, `scenario`, `tests/e2e/` | `agent:project-agentdesk` |
| `area:security`, `ci-red` | `agent:project-agentdesk` |

E2E currently routes to `project-agentdesk` because the GitHub repository has no `agent:adk-e2e-orchestrator` label. Add that label and update the table when the orchestrator becomes a routable issue owner.
