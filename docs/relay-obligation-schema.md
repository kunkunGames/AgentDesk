# Dormant delivery obligation schema

The obligation ledger belongs to the existing delivery record. These dormant
slices add storage/state types, checked proof construction and read-only loading.
Production callers remain zero; existing writers, leases, owners and senders are unchanged.
`LEDGER_PROTOCOL` stays at 0 until every required writer and consumer is wired.
The later serde/read-only loader slices use the same fixture at
`tests/fixtures/delivery_obligation/ledger.json`.

## Publication and identity

The record's optional `obligation_ledger` contains one required `publication`
object: source epoch, protected `extent_end`, 16-byte prefix digest and `rev`.
The extent covers the frontier, every held whole commit, every open range and
every intent; it never shrinks within an epoch. Digest calculation and publication
must recheck the source/coord token under the existing record flock and coord
mutex. The digest checks continuity of `[0, extent_end)`, not delivery success.
`SourceToken` is the single token shared by publication, source observations,
identity-state classification and lease handoff: generation, device, inode,
serial and reset incarnation. Follow-up source evidence reuses this type.
Legacy frontiers never acquire a current token through deserialization.
`SourceObs` carries the publication captured before hashing with its measured
digest, allowing the loader to reject a changed epoch, extent, digest or revision.

Only the absence of both frontier `source_dev` and `source_ino` means legacy.
One missing field is `IdentityIncomplete`. Serialization omits absent identity
fields. Registration, receipt append, withdrawal and equal/lower-END commits
preserve that absence. Only a greater-END whole commit can bind the frontier,
using the admission token after rechecking it against the current source.

The loader must reject unknown schema/protocol versions and unknown ledger
variants without rewriting the record. Fence presence is a deny-only input;
its revision is diagnostic and need not equal the ledger revision. Missing fence
for an active ledger requires repair; empty ledger with a fence is IncompleteClear.
The read-only loader reports those states without repairing either file.
Unknown top-level fields and sections must survive document roundtrips and any
later rewrite. Unknown fields in understood publication, obligation and attempt sections fail closed.
All source evidence is valid only for its recorded publication (epoch, E, digest,
rev); a revision advanced by an unaware writer invalidates that evidence and the
reader must refuse restoration. Empty-ledger evidence fields and semantics remain
follow-up work.

## Lease and settlement

`FlightHandoff` is owned by an existing lease guard. Its states distinguish
Admitted (including whether intent was written), Issuing, Settled and Released.
The eventual Issuing transition and removal from `fresh` share one synchronous
coord critical section. Release hands off before releasing the lease, ignores
stale tokens and performs no await, I/O or detached task. Settled and Released
never recreate Unknown work. Controller, sink and no-anchor recovery guards
must all use this contract when wired, including the admission-pinned
`transport_nonce`: an Issuing flight enters `empty_unknowns` only when the ledger
was empty and this nonce is absent. An attempt key is not a nonce-presence flag.

`u_rev` is a separate in-memory safety revision. Pending, coord generation,
unavailable and reset-pending changes increment it immediately under the coord
mutex, including failed publications. U changes increment it at successful
publication. `suppress_begin` creates no candidate while unavailable or
reset_pending is set. Under the same mutex, `suppress_finish` requires all four:
unchanged revision, no overlap with U or pending, !unavailable and !reset_pending.

Protocol 1 conservatively keeps ambiguous errors, including HTTP 4xx, Unknown.
It enables neither redrive nor operator settlement. Its intent withdrawal is
limited to pre-POST cancellation and write-ahead failure. Protocol 2 typed
NotIssued/FirstRejected outcomes can prove non-delivery; MaybePosted cannot.
WholeProof requires all planned chunks for the same epoch/attempt, no cleanup,
and an unchanged epoch/attempt/revision at settlement. ChunkProof and Ambiguous
remain unresolved. No operator retry permit exists. Whole-attempt payloads and
EvidenceSnapshot have private fields, no deserialization bypass, and only a
validated constructor. The constructor checks the complete durable chunk plan,
unique complete chunk numbers, nonce/receipt/cleanup and publication/attempt
binding. Settlement must still recheck the publication under its lock in the
later settlement slice.

## Durable diagnostics

Attempt preparation time is `prepared_at_ms`, recorded at write-ahead; it does
not claim transport was issued. The duplicate `started_ms` field is omitted;
no separate transport-start timestamp is inferred. Unobserved timestamps and unknown chunk plans
stay absent. Receipts retain chunk numbers, message IDs and cleanup state.
`unresolved_since_ms` is recorded in the publication entering Unresolved.

**At the no-progress cap transition, emit `relay_obligation_redrive_capped`
immediately.** Persist `redrive_capped` on the open obligation in that transition:
its exact range, cap time, next rearm time and last rejection. The owning record
and publication epoch provide channel and source scope. This diagnostic grants
neither a retry nor settlement. Status must not create, normalize or repair it.
D1a and ON require cap -> immediate alert -> restart reconstruction -> rearm
event tests, including a row veto and preserved obligations. This type-only
slice does not emit alerts or implement that later runtime gate.

## Limits

The split is S0a-1a storage types, S0a-1b sealed state types, then local S0a-2
pieces for validated construction, serde, fence and read-only load. Each piece
adds at most 100 production Rust lines. No intermediate loader is activated. Record writer integration,
restart durability barriers, source digest I/O and all runtime transitions are
later slices. The fixture is a schema example, not permission to activate it.
