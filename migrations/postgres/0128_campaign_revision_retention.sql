-- Each revision stores a full copy of the DAG, so an active campaign grew the
-- history unboundedly; 0121's "every accepted revision is retained" no longer
-- holds. Writes now keep only the newest few, and this removes the backlog that
-- accumulated before that bound existed, including campaigns that never get
-- written again. It deletes rows, so the space returns to the table on vacuum
-- rather than shrinking the files here, and one campaign with hundreds of large
-- snapshots produces a single sizeable WAL burst. The literal mirrors
-- campaigns::REVISION_RETENTION.
