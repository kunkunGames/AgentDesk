-- #2362 / #2164 Voice A — VoiceTurnLink durable store.
--
-- Canonical bridge between a voice channel and the background text channel
-- that owns a routed voice turn. The link survives process restarts and
-- powers reverse lookups for:
--
--   * Final TTS playback target resolution (voice_channel_id from
--     dispatch_id; #2164 C6).
--   * Barge-in cancel routing — given the source voice channel resolve the
--     active background target (#2164 C7).
--   * agent:done audible feedback routing (#2164 C8).
--
-- Lifecycle:
--   1. Insert at voice → background dispatch creation. status='active'.
--   2. Retarget (different background channel for the same utterance):
--      previous generation is marked 'cancelled', a new row with
--      generation+1 is inserted as 'active'. Simple retries colliding on
--      the same (guild, voice_channel, utterance, generation) tuple are
--      deduped via ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING.
--   3. Terminal delivery (TTS finished, run_completed, etc.) sets
--      status='terminal'. Terminal rows are eventually GC'd by the
--      leader-only maintenance scheduler.

-- At most one 'active' row per (guild, voice channel, utterance). This is
-- the schema-level invariant that retarget_voice_turn_link_pg's
-- transaction relies on. Without it, two concurrent retargets running at
-- READ COMMITTED could each pass the "cancel prior actives" UPDATE
-- without seeing the other's not-yet-committed INSERT, both commit, and
-- leave two active rows for the same utterance — making reverse-lookup
-- (which active background channel owns this voice turn?) ambiguous.
-- The partial unique index forces the second committer to fail and
-- retry, so the application-level ordering is backstopped by the DB.
