# Regression test for #6090: a deploy that aborts after Postgres may have advanced,
# but before the staged binary is promoted, must not leave the node on a binary
# sqlx refuses to boot (mac-mini crash-looped this way on migrations 113/116/120/122).
#
# The recovery must not overreach either. The restart-durability gate refuses to
# stop a runtime whose in-flight delivery frontier is not proven durable; recovering
# by stopping that runtime anyway would discard exactly what the refusal protected.
# So promote forward only when nothing is serving, and otherwise preserve the one
# binary that can boot and leave the runtime alone.
