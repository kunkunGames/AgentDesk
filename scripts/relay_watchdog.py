"""Out-of-band Discord relay gap watchdog (#4381).

Why out-of-band: the in-band relay audit runs INSIDE the agent whose relay is
being watched, so when the relay dies its findings cannot reach the user either.
On 2026-07-09 that produced 2h07m of silence, 1h34m of it AFTER the agent
announced "relay recovered" on the strength of a dcserver health check it never
cross-checked against actual delivery.

This process compares the SOURCE (the agent's own session transcript under
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*.jsonl`) against the RELAY (what actually landed in
Discord via `agentdesk discord read`) and alerts through paths that do NOT
traverse the turn-relay being watched:

  primary : `agentdesk send-to-agent --from system` (announce bot) — trips the
            target agent's intake_gate and TRIGGERS A TURN, so the agent is
            woken to investigate rather than only the human being notified.
  fallback: `agentdesk discord-sendmessage` — posts with the bot token directly
            and needs nothing but the token. On 2026-07-09 it was the ONLY path
            that survived the outage.

Absence is the thing being detected, so reading Discord alone can never find it.

Deployment (owned by `scripts/deploy-release.sh`):
  script : staged to   $ADK_REL/bin/relay-watchdog.py
  launchd: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agentdesk.relay-watchdog.plist
           (RunAtLoad + KeepAlive; independent of dcserver — dcserver dying is
           precisely the moment this must stay alive, see #4379/#4381)
  config : $ADK_REL/config/relay-watchdog.json (machine-local, deploy-preserved;
           channel ids are OPERATOR CONFIG, never hardcoded here)

There is deliberately NO self-expiry / self-uninstall: the 07-09 prototype's
TTL+idle self-destruction nearly removed the watchdog on a FALSE idle reading
(it was tailing a dead worktree's transcript). Production lifetime is owned by
the deploy, not by the process itself.
