"""Aggregate the #5464 (#5071 T5) relay-authority observation log.

The S2 slice writes one JSONL event per turn per gate to
``<agentdesk root>/relay_authority/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl``. Design r3 §5.1 chose that
event log over an in-process rolling aggregate precisely so the aggregation
could live here, out of the production binary — this script is the whole cost
of that choice, and it adds **0 production LoC**.

Design §5.3 makes the promotion decision a human procedure reading this output,
not an automatic gate. The exit status therefore reports whether the axis-A
criteria are *met*, so a runbook step can branch on it, but nothing in the
running system consults it.

Time base: every promotion window, day count and segment boundary here is keyed
only on axis-A lifecycle records' ``observed_at`` (when the turn started), NOT on
``ts`` (when the record was published). Completion ``observed_at`` values are
telemetry-only and cannot move a promotion window. Publication and observation
times differ by design — a turn stranded by a bridge exit is published when the
*next* turn on its channel arrives, which for an idle channel is hours or days
later, and windowing on ``ts`` dated exactly the populations this slice exists to
measure to the wrong day (ERRATUM R3-E4/E4-5).

Completion R0–R4 records are displayed separately and never enter segmentation,
turn/day counts, publication provenance, coverage, or integrity denominators.
Their fresh reads are independent, non-atomic samples: a prefix may survive a
crash and different sites may describe different mailbox episodes, so the rows
must not be interpreted as one completion snapshot.

Complete axis-B v1 wire records also leave axis-A events and integrity
denominators. ``axis_b_lines`` counts those exclusions per file, in the target
file aggregate, and across all files; it is diagnostic, never a promotion input.
Unknown schemas and incomplete axis-B records remain unusable. Existing scope
limits are unchanged: corruption in a file with no target axis-A record,
including an undated file, is displayed but not judged by the scoped criterion.

Promotion criteria (design §5.3, S2's share of the table). All of them are
evaluated over ONE segment — the newest contiguous run of samples at a single
cohort fingerprint — never over the whole input, so samples from two different
dial positions cannot be added up into one promotion case:

* ``window_days``          — ≥7 distinct days of samples
* ``turn_samples``         — ≥200 distinct turns (≥500 for stage 2)
* ``new_stricter``         — MUST be 0. A nonzero value means the AC2-R gate
                             would have ended a lifecycle the shipped gate kept,
                             which the monotone-relaxing contract forbids and
                             which blocks S4/S7a outright.
* ``loop_exit_coverage``   — matched distinct exits per distinct entry episode, floored.
* ``stream_coverage``      — matched distinct streams per distinct entry episode, floored.
* ``line_integrity``       — unusable lines, capped, as a share of the target
                             segment's own records plus them (see below).

Coverage uses distinct entry-anchored episode/site pairs, not line counts.
Exact replays cannot increase coverage, turn/day floors, stream counters or the
integrity denominator. Conflicting records and missing/invalid u32 stream
counters keep ``new_stricter`` unknown and block promotion; measured positive
witnesses remain visible as lower bounds. Historical reports must be recomputed.

The last three are what make an incomplete log fail instead of pass. The
JSONL sink is best-effort by contract (nothing may propagate back into the turn
that produced it), so a full-disk or half-written window is reachable, and a
turn's three site records are three separate writes. Counting turns alone cannot
tell that apart from a quiet window: 200 entry-only turns satisfied every
turn-counting floor while carrying no stream-gate evidence at all, which is the
only evidence S4 is promoted on (legB P1-2).

Segmentation: ``config_live_reload`` keeps no generation counter (§5.2), so two
rollout windows at the same dial position share a fingerprint. The primary
boundary is therefore not a clock threshold but the input's own witness that the
dial moved — a sample carrying a *different* fingerprint sitting between two
samples of one fingerprint. See [`segment_events`] for why that is the canonical
discriminator and what the gap threshold is and is not.

Scope of ``line_integrity``: an unusable line cannot be dated — that is what
makes it unusable — so it cannot be assigned to a segment by observation time,
and it is attributed to the *file* it sits in instead. The numerator is
therefore file-scoped; the denominator is NOT. It is the target segment's own
usable record count plus those unusable lines, never the files' whole line
count. Two rounds of the same dilution came from widening it: a whole-input
tally let 10,000 lines of history read a 3.08% loss as 0.19% (legB r2c P1-2),
and the file-scoped tally that replaced it let the previous segment's records
in the target's own first file — daily files are named by publish day, the dial
moves mid-day — read the same 3.08% as 0.92% and flip promotion (legA/legB r3c
P1-1). Only counting the target's own records closes both.

Both residuals of that choice are stated rather than hidden, and they do NOT
point the same way. Unusable lines belonging to a cohabiting segment are charged
to this target: that one is false-red, the direction a promotion gate may err in.
But a file containing NO usable target record is outside the scope entirely,
which drops its unusable lines from the numerator AND the denominator and so
*lowers* the measured share — that residual is FAIL-OPEN. A day of the target's
own window that is unusable end to end shows up only in
``line_integrity_all_files``, and no criterion can see it: a mixed-version schema
bump that left one day of a nine-day window unparseable read ``0/810 = 0.0%``
scoped while the whole input was 55.25% unusable, with ``promotion_ready`` True
(legA rc P1-1).

Neither exclusion is silent and neither is judged: ``cohabiting_usable_lines``
reports the usable lines the scope excluded, ``out_of_scope_unusable_lines`` the
unusable ones. Because the fail-open residual is invisible to all six criteria,
a runbook reading this output has to watch that second field and the
``line_integrity_all_files`` ratio itself before promoting on a green
``line_integrity``.

Known self-blocking limit of the coverage floors: see ``SITE_COVERAGE_FLOOR``.

Reported but deliberately NOT gated: ``publish_reasons`` and the evicted share
derived from them. A turn that leaves the bridge without reaching post-loop
finalize is published by its *successor's* entry gate, and if no successor comes
it is never published at all — a loss no coverage floor can see, because the
three site records of one turn are written in one call and vanish together
(``authority_observation``'s module docstring carries the full statement). The
evicted share is the visible half of that: the fraction of this window that was
one absent successor away from being lost. Whether it should become a floor is
S4's call, recorded in the §12-2 inventory; this script only shows it.

Read its direction carefully: it moves the *wrong* way under the loss it is
about. A turn actually lost while stranded is not in the log at all, so it
lowers the evicted share instead of raising it, and a window that lost every
stranded turn reports 0.0 — indistinguishable from a healthy window where no
turn was ever stranded. A low value is therefore not an all-clear; only a high
value carries information (legA r3c P2-6).

S7a range telemetry is reported, never gated. ``rowless_no_range_share`` joins
Missing-at-entry and loop-exit records from the same observed episode; the entry
``rowless_continuation`` predicate alone is counterfactual, not proof of execution.
Missing/ambiguous pairs leave the headline ratio unknown, with the measured
subset and unresolved population shown separately. A completed pair proves only
that a rowless bridge reached loop exit and recorded a range shape, NOT delivery
of its body. Whole turns lost before publication are still unobservable here.

``frontier_already_covers`` and ``unbound_anchor_left`` count terminal decisions
and unbound-candidate cleanup outcomes. These operation samples are separate
from bridge turns and never change promotion criteria. Missing or conflicting
evidence remains unknown; cleanup enqueue attempts are not recovery receipts.

    """Split the input into contiguous single-fingerprint runs, oldest first.

    Walked in GLOBAL observation-time order, not per fingerprint. A run ends where
    the input itself witnesses that the dial moved: the next sample carries a
    different ``cohort_fingerprint``. That interleaving is the canonical
    discriminator, and it is already in the input — bucketing by fingerprint first
    threw it away, which merged two rollout windows separated by a dial excursion
    shorter than the gap below into one promotion case (legA/legB r2c P1-1: 120
    turns over 4 days plus 100 turns over 4 days, with a 22-hour excursion between
    them, read as one 220-turn 8-day window and passed every floor).

    What the interleaving actually witnesses is narrower than "the dial moved":
    it is "the observed population disagreed about the fingerprint".
    ``cohort_fingerprint`` carries ``mode`` and ``percent`` and not the host, so
    while a config rollout is part-way across hosts, two hosts' samples alternate
    second by second and shred the window into many one-sample runs, leaving a
    target far smaller than the real one. The direction is fail-closed — the
    floors under-count and refuse promotion — so it is a declared domain rather
    than a defect, but it is a domain (legA r3c P2-3).

    ``SEGMENT_GAP_HOURS`` remains as a secondary heuristic for the cases the
    input *cannot* witness: the dial left the observing set entirely so nothing
    was recorded, or samples did exist during the excursion and were all lost
    while stranded (low reachability, since eviction bounds unpublished turns at
    one per channel — legA r3c P2-4). Either way there is no interleaved sample
    to find. It is a judgement about
    how long a channel may go quiet and still be one window — not a derived bound.
    The r2 docstring argued it from "a gap this wide contains at least one calendar
    day with no sample"; that property is true (a gap > 48h strictly contains some
    calendar day) but it does not discriminate, because a 25-hour gap can contain
    an empty calendar day too and is deliberately NOT split, and the
    ``window_days`` floor counts distinct days without requiring them to be
    consecutive (legA r2c §6). The comparison is ``>=`` so that a gap of exactly
    the threshold splits rather than merges.

    Denominator: the target segment's distinct usable records, PLUS every unusable
    line in the files those records were read from. Deliberately not the whole
    line count of those files. A daily file is named by publish day and the dial
    moves mid-day, so the target's first file routinely also holds the previous
    segment's records for that day; counting them diluted the target's own
    losses below the ceiling exactly as the whole-input tally used to (legA/legB
    r3c P1-1: a target losing 20 of its own 650 lines, 3.08%, read as 0.92%
    against 1,530 cohabiting lines and flipped ``promotion_ready`` to True).
    Cohabitation is the default at segment birth, not a corner case, and it is
    worst when the target's sample is thinnest.

    An unusable line has no observation time — that is what makes it unusable —
    so it cannot be split between the segments sharing its file, and it is
    charged to the target whole. Both residuals of that choice are declared
    rather than hidden, and they point OPPOSITE ways:

    * a cohabiting segment's unusable lines are charged to this target, so a
      neighbour's corruption can fail a clean target — false-red;
    * a file holding NO usable target record is outside the scope entirely,
      which takes its unusable lines out of the numerator AND the denominator
      and so *lowers* the measured share — FAIL-OPEN, not false-red. A day's
      file that is unusable end to end shows up only in
      ``line_integrity_all_files``. Both ends of that are reachable: history
      files accumulate exactly the interleaved junk ``MALFORMED_LINE_CEILING``
      documents as expected, so 36 such lines beside a clean target read
      ``0/630 = 0.0%`` here while the whole input is 4.26%; and a mixed-version
      schema bump can lose one whole day of the target's own window, which read
      ``0/810 = 0.0%`` scoped against 55.25% unusable whole-input and left
      ``promotion_ready`` True (legA rc P1-1).

    ``out_of_scope_unusable_lines`` is what bounds the second residual: it is the
    only way to audit that exclusion from this output, and like
    ``cohabiting_usable_lines`` it is displayed, never judged. No criterion can
    see the fail-open residual, so the runbook — not this script — is what has to
    read that field and the whole-input ratio next to a green ``line_integrity``.

    Dating an unparseable line by its position between the datable lines around
    it would close both, and is a machine for S4 rather than this slice (§12-2).
