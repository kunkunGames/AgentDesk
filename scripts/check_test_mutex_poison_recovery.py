"""Every acquisition of a process-global `Mutex<()>` must recover the poison (#5185).

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A COMMENT
--------------------------------------
The rule it enforces was written down in `src/config.rs` first, and the same
sweep that produced the rule then measured what a documentation-only rule is
worth. One real failure (`voice_pcm_harness_unattended_e2e`) reported itself as
eleven, because every later acquirer of `config::shared_test_env_lock()` spelled
its acquisition `.lock().unwrap()` and died on the `PoisonError` the first panic
left behind. That was repaired site by site. A later sweep then turned one real
failure (`session_resume::tests::resume_production_path_clears_stale_binding_and_rebinds_runtime`)
into 68 -- 67 of 73 panics were `PoisonError` -- because the repair had been
applied to *that one mutex* while `tui_prompt_dedupe::TEST_LOCK`, a different
process-global `Mutex<()>` serialising 66 tests, still propagated.

So the class recurred once after being fixed, and recurred again after being
documented. `grep` over the tree found no script, lint, or test asserting it.
This repository has a name for a gate that exists only as prose: #5003.

THE RULE
--------
For every process-global `std::sync::Mutex<()>` in `src/` -- a `static`, or a
function returning `&'static Mutex<()>` -- every `.lock()` on it must recover a
poisoned guard instead of propagating the error. `.unwrap()`, `.expect(..)` and
`?` propagate; `unwrap_or_else(|poison| poison.into_inner())` and an explicit
`Err(poisoned) => poisoned.into_inner()` match recover.

WHY IT STOPS AT `Mutex<()>`
---------------------------
The unit payload is what makes blanket recovery unconditionally safe: there is
no data invariant a panicking holder could have torn, so the poison flag carries
no information a waiter must respect. A `Mutex<HashMap<..>>` is different and is
deliberately out of scope -- recovering one of those is a decision about the
guarded value, not about lock hygiene. `tokio::sync::Mutex` is out of scope too:
it cannot be poisoned at all.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE
------------------------
It is a text scan, not a borrow-checked analysis of receiver types.

* It flags the four spellings that were actually measured turning one failure
  into a cascade -- `.unwrap()`, `.expect(..)`, `?`, and an `unwrap_or_else`
  whose closure never calls `into_inner`. It does NOT demand that every other
  shape recover. An earlier revision did, and every one of its 32 findings was
  a false positive: a `match` that recovers in a different syntax, a forwarding
  shim (`turn_orchestrator::SharedEnvLock::lock`) that hands the `LockResult`
  to a caller which recovers, and `unwrap_or_else(PoisonError::into_inner)`
  written as a path rather than a closure. A gate that cries wolf 32 times is
  a gate that gets deleted, so this one asserts less and means it.
* An acquisition that DISCARDS the poison rather than propagating it is not
  flagged, because none of those four spellings appear in it. The reachable
  shape is `if let Ok(_g) = SOME_LOCK.lock() { .. }` (and its `while let` /
  `.ok()` relatives). This is not a milder failure than `.unwrap()`, it is a
  worse one: once the mutex is poisoned the `Ok` arm never matches again, so
  the critical section is silently SKIPPED and mutual exclusion is lost for
  every later acquirer -- with no panic, no `PoisonError` in the transcript,
  and nothing for a cascade to point at. It is also exactly the refactor that
  clippy and review pressure produce when an author is told to stop writing
  `.unwrap()`, so it is arrived at by ordinary means rather than contrived.
  Widening the patterns to cover it is tracked separately; today it is a known
  hole, not a covered case.
* A `.lock()` reached through an alias (`let m = &SOME_LOCK; m.lock()`) or
  through a helper that takes `&'static Mutex<()>` as a parameter is not
  attributed to the static, so it is neither checked nor reported. The
  inventory below names what IS attributed, and it is printed on every run so
  the covered set is reviewable rather than assumed.
* Conversely, a same-named local binding shadowing an inventory name would be
  checked as if it were the static. That direction is fail-closed: it can only
  demand recovery somewhere it was not required, never permit propagation.
* Declaring a new process-global `Mutex<()>` inside a macro body, or behind a
  type alias, hides it from the inventory.
