"""Ratchet destructive Rust call sites by category and exact per-file count.

This is a bounded lexical inventory, not a Rust/type/data-flow analysis and not
proof that any listed destruction is safe.  It scans stripped source text for:
tmux kill wrappers; watcher AtomicBool ``store(true, ...)`` calls; process kill
calls; watcher-registry removal calls; and (#5071 relay-tail S4)
``under_identity_fence`` and ``with_terminal_delivery_fence`` bindings.  The
first two categories include test call sites, matching the #5071 map.  Process,
registry and fence categories reuse the repository's existing lexical
``cfg(test)`` classifier and exclude whole test modules.  Aliases, re-exports,
macros that construct names, indirection, and semantically equivalent spellings
can remain unseen.

The ``identity_fence_bind`` and ``delivery_fence_bind`` categories are the
inverse of the others: they count the FENCED entry points, not unfenced
destruction.

The ``structural_candidate_apply`` and ``destructive_warrant_bind`` warrant
categories require equal per-file pair counts and fail closed on either
one-sided mismatch. This is a two-sided check, not a no-growth check: one-sided
deletion is rejected by pairing, while a paired addition in an existing file or
a move to a new destination requires a reviewed baseline diff. The bounded
lexical inventory cannot detect paired deletion, a count-preserving relocation,
or replacement of one pair by another pair in the same file.

Its remaining limits are explicit:

* **Return-value discard:** the inventory counts calls, not whether the warrant
  result is consumed. Spelling both symbols while discarding the warrant bool is
  invisible. The stale-sweep behavioral witness, not the return type, enforces
  consumption by proving that a production veto stops destructive apply.
* **Argument identity:** equal counts do not prove both calls describe the same
  candidate.
* **Control-flow dominance:** equal counts do not prove the warrant dominates the
  destructive operation or that no branch bypasses it.
* **Unused diagnostics are not enforcement:** some named discarded results may
  receive an ordinary unused-binding warning, for either struct or scalar
  returns, but ``_``/``_name`` can suppress it and ``DestructiveWarrant`` has no
  ``#[must_use]`` contract. It is neither type enforcement nor required-CI
  protection.

The behavioral witness covers return-value discard and veto bypass. It does not
prove argument identity or control-flow dominance at other sites.

Pinning fence binders does NOT make an unfenced destructive removal
impossible — those spell the unfenced helper names and land in
``registry_remove`` instead.  What it does is force any change to the set of
fence-bearing call sites (adding one, moving one, deleting one) to appear as a
reviewed baseline diff in the same commit, so an S4 fence cannot be silently
detached from a call site that keeps its ``registry_remove`` count.

The two fence categories are additionally checked AGAINST EACH OTHER, per file,
by :func:`pairing_errors` — a fenced site must carry both binders, so the counts
must be equal in every file that has either.  This is deliberately two-sided and
NOT a no-growth check: dropping ``.with_terminal_delivery_fence(..)`` from a
site that keeps ``under_identity_fence(..)`` is a DECREASE, which the growth
ratchet permits by design, and it is exactly the silent unfencing this guards.
The compiler is the other half — ``TmuxWatcherRegistry::under_identity_fence``
returns a view with no destructive method, so at this SHA that same deletion
also fails to typecheck.  This check exists because that is a property of one
type's shape, which a refactor can relax without anyone noticing, while a
pairing diff is visible in review.

``inflight_row_clear_call`` (#5462 S5) pins, per file, the calls to an inflight
ROW-DESTRUCTION helper made from OUTSIDE the owner module
``src/services/discord/inflight/clear_store/``.  The owner exclusion is the same
idiom ``registry_remove`` uses for ``REGISTRY_OWNER``: definitions and
helper-to-helper composition live there, and pinning them would count the
implementation instead of its consumers.  The callee's NAME carries the
destructive meaning here, which is why it sees helper-mediated destruction that a
counter keyed on path-resolution symbols cannot: in this repository the callee,
not the caller, resolves the inflight path.  Its limits:

* A SPELLING count, not a semantic one.  Definitions and re-export wrappers are
  counted too.  Harmless for a no-growth ratchet, wrong if read as "number of
  destruction sites".
* Direct ``fs::remove_file`` unlinks are INVISIBLE.  ``inflight/removal.rs``,
  ``inflight/rebind_reap.rs`` and ``inflight.rs`` unlink directly and count 0 for
  those unlinks.  Helper-mediated class only; the direct-unlink surface is a
  separate issue.
* The generation-fenced ``*_for_reconcile`` wrappers count AS destruction, not as
  a separate fenced-entry-point category.  They delegate to the same unlink, and
  excluding them would blind the category on the very reconcile sites it exists
  to pin: those sites spelled the bare helper when the baseline was designed, so
  converting one to its fenced form would otherwise read as a DECREASE the
  no-growth ratchet waves through.  Whether the fence actually refuses is a
  runtime property this file cannot see — ``reconcile_gate.rs`` counts that.
* Aliases, re-export call names, macro-assembled names, general indirection and
  semantically equivalent spellings stay unseen, same as every other category.
  A named row-destruction entry point that this repository already exposes is
  NOT in that residual — it belongs in the pattern.
  ``clear_inflight_state_for_channel``,
  ``archive_inflight_state_if_matches_identity_generation*`` (renames the row
  into the archive path, so the inflight row is gone) and
  ``clear_lifecycle_inflight_state_if_matches*`` were left out by the #5462 §4.5
  enumeration and are in the pattern as of S5 r2; each has production consumers
  that the earlier pattern let grow without limit.

``host_terminate`` counts spellings of the Herdr close RPCs (``pane.close``,
``server.stop``) across all of ``src/**`` including tests: each string or char
literal after escape decoding, and ``stringify!`` tokens; pieces joined only by a
real concatenation (``concat!`` arguments, ``+`` chains, ``[..].concat()`` or
``.join(sep)``, positional ``format!``-family arguments), counted when a match
spans a join so no piece counts twice; and the method names as identifier word
parts in any case style (``PaneClose``, ``RPCPaneClose``, ``herdr_server_stop``,
``CLOSE_PANE``), which also covers ``use ... as`` aliases and wrapper
definitions. Array elements, tuple items and call arguments are never joined, and
completed-state names (``PANE_CLOSED``) do not count. It is owner-only, not merely
no-growth: a count in any file but ``HOST_TERMINATE_OWNER`` fails even when the
baseline lists it, and owner growth still needs a reviewed baseline diff. Pieces
passed through a variable, built at runtime (``push_str``, ``+=``) or read from a
non-Rust file stay unseen, and the count proves nothing about the warrant a call receives.

``--check`` rejects growth in an existing file, every UNLISTED file, any
host_terminate spelling outside its owner, and any identity/delivery pairing
mismatch.  A decrease is allowed for growth: this is a
no-growth ratchet.  For an intentional change, run ``--write-baseline`` and
review the JSON diff in the same commit.
