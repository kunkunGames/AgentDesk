"""Serialize the release scripts' Cargo builds behind one locked build token.

`run()` takes an exclusive `flock` on the token, runs one foreground command
while holding it, and releases only after that direct child is reaped, so a
second wrapper blocks while a first wrapper's build is still alive.

Wiring is scoped, not universal: build-release.sh and deploy-release.sh route
through this wrapper; `Makefile`'s signing target and install.sh's source
install do not, and the #5663 owner test pins that list by scanning the repo.

Signal supervision is *derived*, not enumerated. Earlier revisions carried a
hand-written list of terminating signals; it missed eight, then missed SIGEMT,
and each miss let the wrapper die while its build ran on, freeing the token.
`supervised_signals()` inverts the default: every signal the platform reports is
supervised unless it lands in a small standards-anchored exception set, so a
signal this file never names is still covered.

Scope stays bounded: SIGKILL/SIGSTOP cannot be caught, synchronous faults are
excluded, and supervision reaches the wrapper and its direct child only.
Descendants outliving that child are not covered and no process-group kill is
used, because the build's group intentionally holds an sccache daemon.

An explicit --delegate-lease permits one cooperative wrapper hop. Ordinary
children inherit no lease; this does not make whole-deploy wrapping or ABBA safe.

Waiting is first-come-first-served. `acquire()` retries a non-blocking flock, so
the kernel never queues the waiters; on 2026-09-17 that let a lane release the
token and immediately re-enter, winning every handoff while a process that had
waited 49 minutes never saw a free window (#5968). Waiters therefore take a
numbered ticket next to the token and only the oldest one retries.

# sccache opt-in for campaign cargo, which reaches cargo only through here: a shell
# export of RUSTC_WRAPPER dies with the batch, and .cargo/config.toml ships
# `rustc-wrapper = ""`, so the environment is the only switch. The probe order and the
# /opt/homebrew/bin, $HOME/.cache/sccache, 40G and 0 literals are copied from
# `setup_sccache_env` (scripts/_defaults.sh:25) -- a bash function and a dict cannot
# share an implementation -- so those four defaults move in both places or neither.
# Two rules deliberately do NOT mirror it; do not "fix" them into agreement.
# (1) Precedence. setup_sccache_env is imperative -- build-release.sh, deploy-release.sh
# and install.sh call it to turn sccache on, so overwriting RUSTC_WRAPPER is the point
# of the call. This is ambient, so a caller decision stands, "" included: env beats
# .cargo/config.toml and "" is that file's own "no wrapper", which the release scripts
# export paired with CARGO_BUILD_RUSTC_WRAPPER. Both keys are therefore honoured, which
# also makes this a no-op under CI, whose workflows set RUSTC_WRAPPER at the `env:`
# level. (2) An unusable cache dir: the shell exports first and leaks mkdir's exit code,
# while here nothing is written at all. POSIX only; see docs/ci/sccache-setup.md 2.4.
