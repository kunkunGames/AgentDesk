//! #5147: forensics the self-watchdog records when it decides the runtime is
//! unresponsive.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Three investigations (#4756, #4770, #5147) tried to explain watchdog kills
//! from the `sample` dump that `discord::health::recovery::spawn_watchdog`
//! captures, and all three stalled. The dump cannot answer the question, for a
//! structural rather than incidental reason: a `sample` of *any*
//! `#[tokio::main]` process shows the main thread parked in
//! `_pthread_cond_wait` (sitting in `Runtime::block_on`) and most
//! `tokio-rt-worker` threads parked the same way (no work), with one worker in
//! `kevent` (it holds the I/O driver). A *healthy* AgentDesk shows exactly that
//! shape, so the shape proves nothing.
//!
//! What the dump also cannot show is what actually matters: the watchdog probes
//! `GET /api/health`, that handler `await`s several Postgres queries, and a task
//! blocked in an `await` is not a running thread — it does not appear in a
//! thread sample at all.
//!
//! So this module records the three facts the dump structurally cannot carry.
//!
//! ### 1. Which stage of the probe failed — [`HealthProbeOutcome`]
//!
//! `ConnectFailed` means the TCP handshake never completed; `NoResponse` means
//! the connection was established and the request written, but no bytes came
//! back before the read timeout.
//!
//! **This field on its own does not separate a wedged runtime from a slow
//! handler, and it must not be read that way.** The listen backlog completes
//! the handshake *in the kernel*, with no participation from the accept loop, so
//! a runtime that never polls its acceptor still lets `connect()` succeed —
//! measured at 0.1 ms — and then times out on read, classifying as `NoResponse`
//! exactly like a healthy runtime waiting on a slow query. The backlog depth is
//! a kernel limit, not a tokio one (`mio` asks for `-1` and the kernel caps it:
//! `kern.ipc.somaxconn`, measured at **128** on the release host). The exact
//! depth does not matter; one free slot completes a handshake the acceptor
//! never sees. So:
//!
//! * `ConnectFailed` means the handshake did not complete: the listening socket
//!   is gone — **or its backlog is full**. The second case matters, and an
//!   earlier draft of this file denied it ("not that the runtime is wedged").
//!   A runtime that never polls its acceptor holds every slot it is given, so
//!   with enough clients it eventually fills all 128 and the next `connect()`
//!   fails. `ConnectFailed` therefore does not acquit the runtime; it only says
//!   the handshake failed. That is why [`verdict`] still consults the beacon
//!   for this stage, and why `undetermined_no_beacon` — not `listener_gone` —
//!   is the honest answer when no beacon ran.
//! * `NoResponse` covers **both** "the runtime is wedged" and "the handler is
//!   waiting on Postgres".
//! * `RequestFailed` means the connection was established and then the request
//!   could not be written. The kernel keeps an accepted socket writable with no
//!   help from the executor, so a *refused* write is a peer-side reset and not
//!   a scheduling symptom — which is why this is the one failure stage
//!   [`verdict`] settles without the beacon.
//!
//!   State the limit, because the stage is a fold and the conclusion is not:
//!   [`probe_health_once`] maps **every** `write_all` error here, so a write
//!   that merely timed out is *not* a peer reset. The request is 70 bytes to
//!   loopback against a far larger socket buffer, so that has never been
//!   observed — but if it happens, `verdict` prints
//!   `connection_reset_before_request` with no evidence behind it, in the one
//!   place that skips the beacon. `err=` on the same line distinguishes them.
//!
//! ### 2. Whether the runtime is scheduling tasks — [`RuntimeLiveness`]
//!
//! This is the discriminator `stage=` cannot be, and why the two are always
//! reported together. [`spawn_runtime_liveness_beacon`] runs one tokio task
//! storing a monotonic timestamp every [`RUNTIME_TICK_PERIOD`]. It depends on
//! the timer driver and a worker thread and nothing else — not the acceptor,
//! not the HTTP stack, not Postgres. A stale tick is positive evidence the
//! runtime stopped polling; a fresh one, that it did not. [`verdict`] combines
//! the two into the single conclusion the watchdog is entitled to draw.
//!
//! Read both labels literally; the asymmetry between them is the whole subtlety.
//! The runtime is multi-threaded (`Runtime::new()`, so `worker_threads =
//! available_parallelism()`, measured at **14** on the release host):
//!
//! * `runtime=stalled` means a task that wakes on a timer and stores two
//!   atomics was not scheduled on **any** of those workers for
//!   [`RUNTIME_TICK_STALE_MS`]. That is a strong statement and it is meant to
//!   be: nothing short of a fully wedged runtime produces it.
//! * `runtime=scheduling` is correspondingly weak. **One** idle worker is
//!   enough to tick the beacon, so it rules out a fully wedged runtime and
//!   nothing weaker. Thirteen of fourteen workers blocked in sync I/O or
//!   `block_in_place` — executor starvation, which *is* the executor's fault —
//!   still reads as `scheduling`, and the `handler_*` verdict that follows would
//!   name the wrong component. `runtime_workers=` is logged beside it so the
//!   next investigator can weigh how much slack that leaves.
//!
//! ### 3. What the database was doing — [`Breadcrumbs`]
//!
//! Every Postgres await on the **public `GET /api/health` path** — the endpoint
//! the watchdog probes — brackets itself with a [`DbProbeGuard`]. Enumerated,
//! because a partial claim would misread as `db_in_flight=0` == "the database is
//! innocent" (all in `services::health_diagnostics`):
//!
//! The site-by-site enumeration and the rule for what counts as one acquire
//! live in `health_diagnostics`' module docs, next to the code. Headline:
//! **9 unconditional sequential acquires**, a 10th with a `health_registry`, an
//! 11th on a providerless cluster standby, each able to block for the pool's
//! 10s `acquire_timeout` against a 5s probe timeout.
//!
//! **Not covered**, stated explicitly so a future reader does not infer more
//! than the counters carry:
//!
//! * `load_channel_session_state`, reached once per mailbox from
//!   `enrich_mailbox_session_state` on `GET /api/health/detail` only. It is
//!   shared with two non-health repair routes, so bracketing it *inside the
//!   function* would count DB work no health probe performed. Bracketing its
//!   health-only call site instead is open and the only obstacle is small — it
//!   returns `Option`, so the predicate has to be `|_| true` rather than
//!   `Result::is_ok`, which would score "no row" as a failure. Left undone
//!   because `/api/health/detail` is not the probed endpoint, **not** because
//!   it cannot be done. That endpoint's active-session audit query is bracketed
//!   anyway, being health-only.
//!
//! The enumeration above is held by the *types* in `health_diagnostics`, not by
//! a test: every health-path function there shadows its `Option<&PgPool>` with
//! a [`ProbedPool`] and the two that take a pool directly take a `ProbedPool`,
//! so no raw handle is in scope to await unbracketed. The exempt routes are
//! exactly the ones that still hold a `&PgPool`. That scope is the **module**,
//! not the health *path*: an await added to a health route elsewhere
//! (`server::routes::health_api`) is outside anything here can see and would
//! silently reopen the `db_in_flight=0` misreading. `ProbedPool`'s own docs
//! list the rest of what the construction does not cover.
//!
//! ## What the log evidence actually supports
//!
//! Stated as an enumeration with **the predicate, the window and the base rate
//! attached**, because the tempting summary ("a watchdog failure means the
//! database was slow") is not true as a universal, and because a bare "X
//! happened just before Y" is not evidence at all until X is shown to be rare
//! at a random moment.
//!
//! ### How to reproduce every number below
//!
//! An earlier draft gave figures without saying what it had counted, and three
//! of them then turned out to be wrong in ways nobody could check from the
//! text. So, exactly:
//!
//! 1. **Corpus.** `~/.adk/release/logs/dcserver.stdout.log` plus its 10 rotated
//!    siblings `.1`–`.10`, **restricted to
//!    `[2026-07-12T23:50:43.386222Z, 2026-08-07T03:18:28.232513Z]`** — 11 files,
//!    **603.462 h** of covered wall clock (the union of each file's first→last
//!    stamp; the files abut to within a second and do not overlap).
//!
//!    ⚠️ **These logs rotate, so the figures below reproduce only inside that
//!    window** and are not stable properties of the deployment. Two
//!    recomputations four days apart disagreed on corpus length (638.0 h vs
//!    603.5 h) purely because `.10` had aged out. Re-derive rather than trust;
//!    if the window is gone, say so instead of quoting these numbers.
//!
//!    Strip the ANSI SGR escapes, then read the RFC3339 stamp at the head of
//!    each line. **That
//!    stamp is UTC**; the `[HH:MM:SS]` inside the message is KST (UTC+9), and
//!    so are the `adk-hang-<pid>-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>.txt` dump names. Parse the
//!    head stamp as an *aware* UTC instant — an earlier analysis parsed it
//!    naive, re-rendered through `utcfromtimestamp`, and shifted every reported
//!    time by −9 h. **Six of the 13 kills land on a different calendar day
//!    under that shift**, including the 2026-08-03 one an earlier draft
//!    therefore reported as 08-02.
//! 2. **Watchdog events.** `watchdog: health check failed (n/3)`,
//!    `watchdog: runtime unresponsive`, `watchdog: health recovered`. A *streak*
//!    opens at `(1/3)` and closes at the next `recovered` or `unresponsive`.
//!    Corpus totals: **33 streaks, 13 of them ending in a kill, 20 recovering**.
//! 3. **Postgres error — `P_pg`.** The pool-acquisition failures the watchdog
//!    can actually be delayed by: a line matching
//!    `pool timed out|PoolTimedOut|Connection refused \(os error 61\)` —
//!    **13 061 lines** in the window.
//!
//!    ⚠️ **`P_pg` is the predicate for every Postgres figure below, with no
//!    per-figure exceptions.** An earlier draft published this regex but
//!    computed three bullets from `pool timed out|PoolTimedOut` alone (944
//!    lines) and one from a fourth; each was individually reproducible and none
//!    reproducible *from the text*, the only property this section is for. A
//!    different predicate, where needed, is named at the point of use.
//! 4. **Base rate.** Not 20 000 Monte-Carlo draws: at these hit counts that
//!    estimator has ±30 % noise and is not reproducible without the seed.
//!    Compute it *analytically* as the covered fraction of the union of
//!    `[error, error + W]` windows — **for every control in this section, not
//!    just the Postgres ones**. Same definition, deterministic answer.
//!
//!    ⚠️ **What that comparison assumes.** Comparing 11/13 against a base rate
//!    over *uniformly random covered instants* treats kill times as drawn from
//!    that same distribution — as carrying no information about when in the
//!    corpus they fall, independently of Postgres. Not free: both are clumped,
//!    so a common cause raising both densities in the same hours (a busy period,
//!    a restart storm) would produce lift without either causing the other. The
//!    lift is large enough that this is unlikely to explain all of it, but it is
//!    why the module ships `db_in_flight` and the beacon, not just correlation.
//!
//! ### The findings
//!
//! * **Kills preceded by a `P_pg` line: 11 of 13, within 5 s.** The 11 deltas
//!   are 0.06, 0.12, 0.44, 0.46, 0.92, 1.04, 1.16, 1.27, 2.56, 2.62 and 4.04 s.
//!   Base rate of that predicate at a uniformly random covered instant:
//!   **0.07975 %** (W = 5 s), so the lift is **≈1060×**. It survives the window
//!   choice — at W = 6 s still 11 of 13 against 0.08589 % (≈985×), at W = 20 s
//!   still 11 of 13 against 0.15772 % (≈537×). That lift is what makes this the
//!   thing the module is built around. The three most recent kills
//!   (`2026-08-04T12:41:08Z`, `2026-08-04T16:43:06Z`, `2026-08-05T16:05:13Z`)
//!   are 3 of 3, at **0.44 s, 4.04 s and 1.04 s** — named events rather than a
//!   trailing-window rate, because an earlier draft's "most recent 58.8 h"
//!   stopped being computable the moment the corpus rotated.
//! * **The two exceptions are not database-quiet — they are a different
//!   database failure.** `2026-08-02T13:21:36Z` and `2026-08-03T03:21:51Z`
//!   (dump names `adk-hang-84772-20260802-222136` and
//!   `adk-hang-32033-20260803-122151`, which are KST — an earlier draft read
//!   both as 08-02) had gone **5.2 h and 19.2 h** with no `P_pg` line. That on
//!   its own is unremarkable — `P_pg` lines are heavily clumped, and the corpus
//!   holds 54 `P_pg`-free stretches of an hour or more, the longest 77.4 h.
//!   (**Endpoint rule**: gaps *between consecutive `P_pg` lines* only. The
//!   right-censored tail — last line to end of coverage, 33.00 h — is excluded;
//!   include it and it is 55. The left head is 0.00 h.) What
//!   singles these two out is only that they are the two kills the 11-of-13
//!   above does not cover.
//!
//!   What they do have is `EADDRNOTAVAIL`, the kernel refusing a *new outbound
//!   connection*. Predicate `P_eaddr` = `Can't assign requested address`:
//!   **20 lines, and every one of them falls between `2026-08-02T13:17:42Z` and
//!   `2026-08-03T03:21:30Z`** — nowhere else in 603 h. Twelve precede the two
//!   kills (13:17:42–13:21:10Z, 03:20:31–03:21:30Z); the other eight are
//!   `[startup] postgres warmup pool unavailable` / `[config-audit]` pairs from
//!   processes that had just restarted (13:22:24, 13:32:36, 15:06:28, 20:51:26),
//!   i.e. downstream of a kill, not before one. ⚠️ An earlier draft said "the
//!   only **9**, in exactly two bursts (7 and 2)" — those 9 are `P_eaddr` **also
//!   restricted to `[policy-tick] advisory lock failed`**, an undisclosed
//!   filter. "Confined to these two days" survives; "two bursts" does not.
//! * **…and those same two streaks own all four instant-fail probes.** Of the
//!   29 consecutive-failure gaps, 23 are 35.02–35.32 s (below) and **4 are
//!   30.07–30.19 s — all four inside these two kills** (08-02: 30.13, 30.15;
//!   08-03: 30.07, 30.19). A 30.1 s gap against a 30 s `CHECK_INTERVAL` means
//!   the probe returned in ~0.1 s: it consumed none of its 5 s timeout, which
//!   is what a `connect()` that fails immediately looks like. So the two facts
//!   an earlier draft listed as separate bullets — "kills with no Postgres
//!   error" and "probes that failed without waiting" — are the same two events.
//!
//!   ⚠️ **That co-location is all this says. n = 2, and no cause is claimed.**
//!   An earlier draft called both "consistent with the host having run out of
//!   the thing a new connection needs" — a mechanism sketched to fit two
//!   observations, and "consistent with" is how a hypothesis gets quoted back
//!   as a conclusion. With two events there is no base rate to test it against,
//!   the direction is untested (the port shortage could as easily be a
//!   *symptom*), and one episode has `P_eaddr` lines both before and after its
//!   kill. The last confident correlation here (`routines::loader`, below) was
//!   noise. What it buys is a prediction: if the ephemeral-port reading is
//!   right, the next such event renders `stage=connect_failed` with `verdict` at
//!   `listener_gone` or `undetermined_no_beacon`, never `handler_*`.
//! * **First failures whose last `P_pg` line was an hour or more earlier:
//!   11 of 33** — 2.0, 5.2, 5.2, 5.2, 11.2, 18.5, 19.2, 19.9, 23.2, 23.3,
//!   27.7 h. **Two** of those escalated to a kill (the two above). (An earlier
//!   draft listed 2.0, 13.1, 18.5, 19.9, 23.2, 23.3, 30.7, 30.7, 30.8, 44.8,
//!   53.3 h — the same 11 streaks against `pool timed out|PoolTimedOut` instead
//!   of `P_pg`; same count, same membership, same two kills, only shorter gaps,
//!   because `P_pg` also sees the refused connections. And an earlier draft said
//!   *four* kills, from a `kill_time - first_failure < 180 s` proximity test
//!   that also matched two streaks which *recovered* after a single failure —
//!   2026-08-02T13:18:04Z and 13:19:05Z — because a later, unrelated kill fell
//!   inside the window.) Attribute a kill to the streak that logged it, not to
//!   the clock.
//!   Something other than Postgres delays the probe often enough to matter, it
//!   is not modelled here, and the beacon plus `db_in_flight` are what will
//!   tell the two apart next time.
//! * **No second trigger has been identified.** An earlier draft attributed
//!   those hour-gap failures to a `routines::loader` burst. That is **withdrawn
//!   as a base-rate error**, and recorded rather than deleted because the next
//!   investigator will find the same correlation and should not have to
//!   re-derive that it is noise. In the 60 s before each of the 11 hour-gap
//!   failures the loader emitted 28, 44, 52, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56
//!   lines, against a control of **p20 = 52, median = 56, p90 = 58** at random
//!   covered instants: eight sit exactly at the modal density and three sit
//!   *below* it. There is no burst. Across all 33 first failures the sign
//!   reverses — 6.1 % (2 of 33) have a loader line within 5 s, versus
//!   **15.0 %** of random covered instants (15.0019 %: analytic union of
//!   `[event, event+5 s]` over 1 788 762 `routines::loader` lines ÷ 603.462 h).
//!   An earlier draft said 15.2 %, from sampling the timeline on a 10 s grid
//!   instead of the analytic union this section mandates. Same predicate, wrong
//!   method; the section's own rule catches it. Two corrections travel with this: the control's p10 is **0**,
//!   not 50 (10.4 % of the corpus — 62.7 h — has no loader line in the preceding
//!   minute at all, in stretches beginning at the kills themselves, e.g. 17.9 h
//!   from `2026-08-04T16:42Z`), and the loader's mean rate of 0.62 line/s is
//!   dropped rather than quoted, because 0.62 × 60 = 37 is below every observed
//!   count and so makes a *modal* minute look like a burst. The output is
//!   clumped; only the density-controlled comparison discriminates.
//! * **Failing probes wait the timeout out: 23 of 29** consecutive-failure gaps
//!   are 35.02–35.32 s against a 30 s `CHECK_INTERVAL` — the probe's own 5 s
//!   read timeout elapsing in full, so those probes *waited* rather than being
//!   refused: "connected, handler never answered", and not a dead listening
//!   socket. The other 6 are **not** that, and the earlier "~35 s vs ~30 s"
//!   phrasing hid them: 4 are the 30.1 s instant-fails above, 2 are 60.4 s and
//!   90.7 s (2× and 3× the interval, with a successful check between).
//!   ⚠️ The denominator 29 is "diffs between consecutive failure LINES ≤ 100 s".
//!   Every *within-streak* gap with no cutoff gives 31: the 60.4/90.7 s pair
//!   drops out (a `health recovered` sits between them) and four long ones come
//!   in — 238, 962, 1375, 1865 s. Three are in recovering streaks; **the 962 s
//!   one is in a kill streak** (2026-07-14T17:16:04Z, first failure→kill 997.6 s
//!   against ~70 s for every other kill) — the corpus's only evidence that the
//!   watchdog thread's own scheduling is not always prompt.
//!
//! ## Cost and deadlock-safety
//!
//! The recording path is [`DbProbeGuard::new`] plus exactly one of `finish` /
//! `Drop`. The three outcomes do not cost the same, so they are enumerated
//! rather than averaged — "three atomics" was quoted for all three and is right
//! for only one:
//!
//! | outcome | relaxed RMW | relaxed store | clock read |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | success (`finish(true)`) | 3 (`started+`, `in_flight+`, `in_flight-`) | 1 (`LAST_DB_OK_AT`) | 1 |
//! | failure (`finish(false)`) | 4 (the above + `failed+`) | 1 (`LAST_DB_ERR_AT`) | 1 |
//! | cancellation (`Drop`, unsettled) | 3 (`started+`, `in_flight+`, `in_flight-`) | 0 | 0 |
//!
//! No lock, no allocation and nothing that blocks on any of the three paths, so
//! it cannot participate in — let alone deepen — a deadlock. It brackets a
//! Postgres round trip costing milliseconds: overhead ~1e-7 in every column.
//!
//! The beacon costs one timer wakeup per [`RUNTIME_TICK_PERIOD`] and two
//! relaxed stores; it never allocates after spawn and never touches the
//! database, so it cannot itself be blocked by what it is measuring.
//!
//! The reading path ([`snapshot`]) runs on the watchdog's dedicated OS thread,
//! which is not a tokio worker, at most once per 30s check. It only reads
//! atomics, so it stays readable even when every tokio worker is stuck.

/// * It covers only *this* module, not the health *path*
///   (`server::routes::health_api` is the obvious gap).
/// * **The handle is extractable** — see above. A sealed bound on `T` was tried
