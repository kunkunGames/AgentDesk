//! Dispatch follow-up outbox enqueue — service-layer helpers.
//!
//! Previously these helpers lived in `server/routes/dispatches/outbox.rs` and
//! were called back into from service code (`services::dispatches`,
//! `services::discord::turn_bridge`, `server::routes::review_verdict`). That
//! produced a service→route reverse edge in the dispatch call graph.
//!
//! The helpers themselves are pure DB writes (insert into `dispatch_outbox`)
//! with no HTTP/Axum surface, so their correct home is in the service layer.
//! The outbox worker loop still lives under `server::routes::dispatches::outbox`
//! because it owns the Discord side-effect transport — but the *enqueue* side
//! that callers need is now here.
//!
//! Manual dispatch completion (PATCH /api/dispatches/:id), outbox-driven
//! follow-up, review-verdict completion, and recovery/turn-bridge completion
//! all funnel through the same `queue_dispatch_followup_sync` / `_pg` pair,
//! giving the call graph a single finalize guard shape (see
//! `deduplicates_followup_for_manual_and_outbox_sources` test below).
