//! Row coordinate ↔ independently resolved coordinate comparison — 4987 §-1.5 divergence, S4 (#5071 T4-B4). #4986 형상1 was one channel whose in-flight row and live watcher registry named different transcripts; this module compares file **identity** ([`TranscriptFileId`], the `(dev, ino)` pair) rather than path strings, so equal-size different-inode files differ and the same file reached via a symlink or `..` alias agrees.
//!
//! Every outcome is descriptive only (4987 §9.2 S4): nothing here produces a `ReachabilityVerdict`, feeds `RelayStallState`, or authorizes recovery, redelivery, or any destructive action — [`RowCoordinateDivergence::unknown_reason`] only names the [`ReachabilityUnknownReason`] the T4-B6 composition may spell from a non-GREEN outcome, and `obligation`/`ledger` must never depend on this module.
//!
//! Two fail-closed shapes, not one: when the independently resolved side (or both sides) fails to stat, no identity is comparable and the outcome is silent [`RowCoordinateDivergence::Unknown`] (`discovery`'s fail-closed discipline). When the row side fails to stat while the independent side is alive, that is the designed detection, not a retreat — [`RowCoordinateDivergence::RowPathUnresolvableWhileRegistryLive`], mapping to `TranscriptCoordinateDivergence` and firing `reachability_row_coordinate_divergence`. `stat_transcript` answers `None` uniformly for ENOENT, a directory, a broken symlink, and EACCES, so this comparison offers no permission-vs-absence distinction.
