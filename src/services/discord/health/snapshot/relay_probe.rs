//! Operand assembly for the composed relay verdict — #5942. Split out of
//! `super` (`health/snapshot.rs`, a registered giant per
//! `scripts/giant_file_registry.toml`, #5447) with no behavior change: same
//! bodies, `#[cfg(unix)]` moved to the `mod` declaration.
//!
//! The expiry these operands can produce surfaces on
//! `DiscordHealthSnapshot::expired_relay_ledgers`, beside `degraded_reasons`
//! rather than inside it — it must not be silent, but must also not be
//! counted into the degraded axis (that conflation is the saturation #5942
//! reported).
//!
//! An empty vector is NOT the normal steady state; a reader must look at the
//! entry COUNT and `unobserved_for_secs`, never at emptiness. There is no such
//! reader in this repo yet — #5947 tracks adding one or removing the field.

/// The detail path's execution-owner witness (#5942).

///
/// * AGGREGATE (`build_health_snapshot_with_options`) probes
///   `tmux::session_presence` — "does the session exist" — because its
///   derived `tmux_present` bool has consumers across `super` and stall
///   recovery that #5942 does not change;
/// * DETAIL probes `tmux::pane_liveness` — "does the session have a live
///   pane" — matching what `tmux_session_alive` has always published.
///
/// Both share one property the ledger TTL relies on: a probe that could not
/// answer yields [`ExecutorWitness::Unwitnessed`] and therefore cannot expire
/// anything (`PaneLiveness::ProbeError` → `None`; `SessionPresence::ProbeFailed`
/// → `Unwitnessed` in `witness_tmux_session_within`).
///
/// They diverge in three places, pinned by
/// `the_two_health_paths_agree_inside_the_probe_and_diverge_on_the_wedge_the_budget_and_the_blank_name`:
///
/// * dead-pane wedge (session exists, only dead panes) — aggregate reads
///   `Present` (blocks expiry), detail reads `Absent` (would expire);
/// * shared probe budget — only the aggregate path is charged against it, so
///   an exhausted budget withholds only the aggregate witness;
/// * blank session name — `tmux::session_presence` rejects it as
///   `ProbeFailed` → `Unwitnessed`; `tmux::pane_liveness` rejects it as
///   `DeadOrAbsent` → `Some(false)` → `Absent` here.
///
/// The first two err safe: the aggregate path decides `/api/health`'s `ok`
/// and there it refuses to expire. The blank-name divergence is harmless for
/// a different reason — the detail path publishes no expiry, it only
/// abstains from the warrant.
///
/// `(None, None)` is a positive absence, not a probe fault:
/// `probe_tmux_session_alive` returns `None` without probing when there is no
/// session name, matching the aggregate path's rule for the same situation.
