//! #3410 — STALL-WATCHDOG forced-cleanup follow-through: respawn the tmux
//! watcher and release stale mailbox ownership after a force-clean cancels
//! the watcher.
//!
//! ## The dead-zone this closes
//!
//! `run_stall_watchdog_pass`'s desynced force-clean calls
//! `apply_watchdog_orphan_token_cleanup`, which **unconditionally cancels the
//! channel watcher** (`tmux_watchers.remove` + `cancel.store(true)`) for the
//! `StallWatchdog` source and then asks `relay_recovery` to clear the mailbox
//! token — but ONLY when the relay state resolves to `OrphanPendingToken`.
//!
//! The real incident (#3410) fired on `relay_stall_state =
//! "tmux_alive_relay_dead"`, where `plan_relay_recovery` returns
//! `ReattachWatcher`, not `ClearOrphanPendingToken`. So the auto-heal call was
//! `skipped` (action-not-allowed), the mailbox's stale `active_user_message`
//! ownership was NEVER released, and the watcher stayed dead with no respawn.
//! Result: 85 minutes of permanent live-relay death — every later TUI-direct
//! turn got `skipping TUI-direct synthetic inflight; mailbox already owns a
//! different turn`.
//!
//! `recovery_engine`/`relay_recovery` deliberately step aside with
//! `observe_only` when they see "live turn evidence", because their contract
//! is to never disturb a healthy turn. The STALL-WATCHDOG, by contrast, has
//! ALREADY adjudicated this turn dead (it passed the force-clean predicate after
//! the liveness gate allowed cleanup). Once force-clean commits, the
//! cleanup is authoritative and therefore OWNS the recovery: it must release
//! the stale mailbox ownership AND respawn the watcher so the still-alive tmux
//! session keeps relaying. That is the resolution of the observe_only/cleanup
//! contradiction (#3410 requirement 4): **the path that kills the watcher
//! respawns it**; the existing relay-recovery observe_only behaviour is left
//! untouched for its own (non-force-clean) callers.
//!
//! Respawn reuses the canonical spawn mechanism (`registry.rebind_inflight`
//! → `recovery_engine::rebind_inflight_for_channel` →
//! `claim_or_reuse_watcher` + `spawn_observed_tmux_watcher`), so no new spawn
//! site is introduced. A respawn that fails (e.g. transient tmux probe miss) is
//! retried on a later tick under an exponential backoff, and the dead-man
//! switch escalates to ERROR if a watcher that should exist stays absent. After
//! [`WATCHER_RESPAWN_MAX_ATTEMPTS`] consecutive failures the channel is parked
//! for an operator rather than retried forever.
