//! #3805 P2 (PR-C): two-message status-panel WATCHER creation-order parity.
//!
//! The tmux watcher owns a SECOND, fully independent relay path from the bridge
//! sink (`turn_bridge`). PR-B put the sink on the two-message layout (the answer
//! stays first/highest, the live status panel is created as a NEW message BELOW
//! it, opening a per-turn `status_panel_generation` epoch). The operator repro
//! was on the WATCHER path, so this module gives the watcher the SAME creation
//! order and generation semantics under the same default-OFF
//! `placeholder.two_message_panel_enabled` flag.
//!
//! Unlike the sink — which is turn-scoped and mutates a pinned in-memory
//! inflight snapshot — the watcher is NOT turn-scoped and races overlapping
//! watchers, so it keeps its existing atomic `bind_status_panel` publish machinery
//! and only THREADS the two-message decisions through it. This sibling therefore
//! holds just the small PURE predicates the (EXTREME 7122-line, 700-capped)
//! watcher giant and its `single_message_footer.rs` (near the 700 cap) call into
//! thinly:
//!
//! 1. `watcher_two_message_panel_creation_gated_by_answer` — defer panel creation
//!    until the ANSWER placeholder exists, so the panel is created BELOW it
//!    (answer-first). This is the watcher analog of the sink gate's "the answer
//!    is a real message" precondition. OFF: always `true` (byte-identical).
//! 2. Fresh binds/re-anchors ask `bind_status_panel` to bump the generation from
//!    the on-disk row while holding the inflight flock. OFF: the bind leaves the
//!    generation untouched.
//! 3. `watcher_two_message_status_completion_superseded` — the completion guard,
//!    reusing the ONE shared staleness predicate from PR-B's sink sibling
//!    (`turn_bridge::two_message_status_edit_generation_is_stale`) so the sink and
//!    watcher supersede a stale status edit by identical epoch rules. Inert while
//!    every generation is `0` (OFF) or equal (PR-C has no mid-turn re-anchor yet).
