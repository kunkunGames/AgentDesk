/// factored out of the production watcher loop so the EXACT production routing is
/// unit-testable end-to-end (the enclosing `tmux_output_watcher_with_restore` is
/// not). It fuses two independent disambiguators:
///
///   1. The STRUCTURAL completion signal (`CompletionSignal`, S1) — the
///      authority that finally distinguishes "turn done" from "paused-live",
///      which the old flag-only path could not:
///        * `Done`       — a structural JSONL terminator is proven on disk
///                         (Claude `result`/`system`, Codex `turn.completed`).
///                         Even when the committed response text is EMPTY/
///                         suppressed, this is a genuine completed turn → finalize.
///        * `PausedLive` — NO terminator (Busy/Inconclusive): paused at a
///                         selector / permission prompt, a subagent still running,
///                         or a long silent tool call. NEVER finalize → defer.
///        * `Unknown`    — non-JSONL runtime (LegacyTmuxWrapper / ProcessBackend /
///                         ClaudeEAdapter, or a non-JSONL provider): the transcript
///                         probe cannot speak, so the pane-idle proxy is the sole
///                         terminal authority. #3016 phase-5b1 routes `Unknown` to
///                         the SAME finalize path as `Done` (flag-independent): the
///                         fresh-idle gate already PROVES pane idle (it only fires
///                         after `watcher_session_ready_for_input` — the SAME
///                         `pane_ready_fallback_allowed && tmux_session_ready_for_input`
///                         predicate the 5a far-backstop uses for `Unknown` — held
///                         over the idle timeout), so finalizing promptly here is
///                         behaviour-equivalent to the old `mailbox_finalize_owed`
///                         flag (owed was ~always true at this arm), without the
///                         1800s far-backstop latency.
///
///   2. The A2-banked wrong-turn-race defenses (only relevant once the signal
///      says we *would* finalize): a follow-up turn can claim the same session
///      during the cleanup `.await`s, so before the destructive clear we
///        * `AbortFollowupTookOver` — `paused_now || epoch_changed` (the SAME
///          predicate as the canonical pause/epoch guard at tmux.rs:7806, but
///          evaluated HERE because this branch `continue`s before that guard
///          would run); and
///        * `SkipStale` — the PINNED pre-cleanup snapshot is a NEWER turn that
///          began AT/AFTER this committed range (`committed_completion_is_stale_for_newer_turn`,
///          or `pinned_finalize_user_msg_id == 0`). Finalizing would release the
///          follow-up; skip and preserve inflight.
///
/// The two combine so that the defer decision keys on the STRUCTURAL TERMINATOR,
/// not on response emptiness — which is the fix for the contradiction that killed
/// the first A2 attempt (the old defer guard deferred `delegated && empty`, the
/// SAME condition as the empty completion it wanted to finalize, so finalize was
/// unreachable). Here an empty-but-TERMINATED completion routes to `Finalize`.
///
/// Degenerate-empty-offset safety: a genuine current-turn fresh idle always has
/// `turn_start_offset < current_offset` (`FreshIdle` requires `output_ever_grew`,
/// and the watcher resumes at `turn_start_offset`), so the pinned id is its real,
