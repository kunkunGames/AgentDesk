//! #1446 stall-deadlock recovery — shared post-clear bookkeeping.
//!
//! The THREAD-GUARD's stale-thread cleanup (`router::intake_gate`) and the
//! stall watchdog's force-clean path (`health::run_stall_watchdog_pass`)
//! both call `mailbox_clear_channel` on a thread/channel whose original
//! turn task has already died. `mailbox_clear_channel` returns the
//! orphaned `cancel_token` in `ClearChannelResult.removed_token`, but the
//! normal turn-finish lifecycle (`finalize_turn_state` →
//! `cancel_active_token` → `global_active.fetch_sub(1)`) was never run,
//! so without this helper:
//!   - `global_active` stays > 0 forever, blocking deferred-restart
//!     drain (`/api/restart-deferred`) and confusing health-status
//!     reporters that key off active-turn count;
//!   - any leftover child process / tmux session attached to the orphaned
//!     token keeps running outside the mailbox where no watchdog can
//!     reach it.
//!
//! `finalize_orphaned_clear` mirrors the
//! `placeholder_sweeper::finalize_abandoned_mailbox` cleanup pattern so
//! both stall-recovery layers honour the same global-counter invariants
//! as every other turn-end path in the system.

///      / tmux session keyed off it is torn down (mirrors what the
///      normal `finish_turn` → `cancel_active_token` path would have
///      done). We use `CleanupSession` policy so the tmux session is
///      removed too, matching the stall-recovery contract that no
///      orphaned tmux outlives a force-clean.
///   2. Decrement `global_active` so deferred-restart drains and health
///      reporters do not see a phantom active turn.

/// `removed_token == None` means the mailbox was already idle — no
/// bookkeeping is required and the helper is a no-op.

/// `reason` is purely diagnostic; it is passed through to
