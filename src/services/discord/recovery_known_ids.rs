//! #5191 — the identity set the Discord catch-up recovery scan treats as
//! "already known", i.e. messages it must NOT re-enqueue.
//!
//! Three sources make up that set, and they must be read together or the
//! union develops a hole:
//!
//! 1. `intervention_queue` — entries still waiting their turn.
//! 2. `active_user_message_id` — the message whose turn currently holds the slot.
//! 3. `pending_user_dispatch` — the #3167 dequeue→claim reservation, covering
//!    the window where a head has left the queue but has not yet claimed the
//!    slot. Source 1 and 2 are both blind there.
//!
//! Extracted from `discord/mod.rs` so the recovery-dedup contract and its tests
//! live in a non-giant module (`giant_file_ratchet`).
