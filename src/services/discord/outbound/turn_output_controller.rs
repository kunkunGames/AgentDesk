//! #3089 Phase A1 — turn-output controller skeleton (pure add, no owner wired).
//!
//! This module introduces the single delivery entry point that Phase A will
//! eventually route all seven turn-output surfaces through. A1 is a **pure
//! add**: the controller is fully implemented and tested, but NO live owner
//! (sink / standby / watcher / turn_bridge / recovery / tui_prompt_relay) calls
//! it yet — the live-path cutover starts at A2 (`session_relay_sink` first).
//!
//! ## Invariant I1 — commit+advance is owned by the controller, inline, before
//! any post-send await
//!
//! Design §4.1 (review fix H2): an `async deliver_turn_output(...).await`
//! that hands the outcome back for the *caller* to commit is insufficient,
//! because owners (notably the watcher) have post-send awaits before they
//! advance — a caller-side commit can land after an await and re-open the
//! #3143 duplicate. Therefore `deliver_turn_output` performs
//! `lease.commit() + offset advance` **internally, synchronously, immediately
//! after confirmed transport success and before it does any cleanup / status /
//! placeholder-transition / await work**, and returns an already-committed
//! [`DeliveryOutcome`].
//!
//! ## Invariant I2 — ambiguous never advances
//!
//! Design §4.1: an ambiguous transport result (`Unknown` / a transport error
//! classified as transient) must NOT advance the committed offset. The
//! controller `release`s the lease *without* committing in that case, so the
//! durable frontier (Phase B) and the in-memory lease both stay at the
//! pre-send value.
