//! #3886 — TimedOut-completion-gate status-panel reconcile.
//!
//! A warm hosted TUI turn (`AgentDesk-claude-dm-*`, `AgentDesk-claude-adk-cc`,
//! `AgentDesk-codex-adk-cdx`, …) can leave its Discord live status panel stuck
//! at `진행 중 / Active` forever: the `tui_completion_quiescence` gate returns
//! `TimedOut` (a skill turn keeps running past the 3s window for memento writes
//! etc.), so per #2161 the caller SUPPRESSES `StatusEvent::TurnCompleted`. The
//! gate doc names the placeholder sweeper / next-turn intake as the reconcile
//! that closes the lingering Active panel — but neither emitted a panel-finalize
//! event, and on the relay-dead frontier-0 path the watcher GateTimeout
//! finalizer (gated on `terminal_output_committed`) never fires either. The
//! live-events `DerivedStatus::Running` therefore never transitions to
//! `Completed`.
//!
//! This module adds the missing reconcile, driven from the placeholder sweeper:
//! for a still-tracked warm-TUI inflight whose live panel is still unfinished,
//! finalize the panel to `✅ 응답 완료` IFF the matched session's provider JSONL
//! DETERMINISTICALLY confirms the turn is terminal. The decision is on the turn
//! status (the SAME finalize-safe turn-END terminator the `TurnFinalizer` Done
//! decision uses — NOT the lenient idle-queue-drain readiness probe), NEVER on
//! timestamp age — so the panel resolves as soon as the turn is actually done,
//! not on a 600s backstop.
//!
//! Two cross-turn safety invariants keep this honest (codex review #3951):
//!   * DEFECT 1 — it uses [`jsonl_turn_end_terminator_idle`], the turn-END-only
//!     probe, so a NON-terminator Idle-class envelope (Codex
//!     `session_meta`/`thread.started`/`task_complete`/completed `agent_message`;
//!     Claude `system{init}`; a torn trailing fragment) can NEVER false-finalize
//!     a quiet STILL-RUNNING turn.
//!   * DEFECT 2 — it RE-READS the fresh on-disk inflight row and re-verifies the
//!     panel/turn identity right before the finalize edit; if the channel now
//!     hosts a different/newer turn (a NEXT-turn restart raced the stale sweep
//!     snapshot), it NO-OPs rather than completing the new turn's panel.
//!   * DEFECT 3 — on a committed finalize it registers the #3607 committed-
//!     terminal panel anchor, so the SAME-pass orphan-panel reclaim skips the
//!     panel it just finalized instead of deleting it.
//!   * DEFECT 1b (round-2) — the terminal verdict is OFFSET-SCOPED to the current
//!     turn: the unbounded `jsonl_turn_end_terminator_idle` reverse scan can walk
//!     PAST the current turn's non-terminator Idle-class envelopes and latch a
//!     PRIOR turn's terminator below `turn_start_offset`, false-finalizing a turn
//!     that is still running. The reconcile additionally requires the CURRENT
//!     turn's byte slice `[turn_start_offset, EOF)` to contain its OWN turn-end
//!     terminator, so a prior terminator can never confirm this turn's completion.
//!
//! Lives OUTSIDE the #3016 hot files (declared from the non-hot `tmux.rs`); it
//! never re-runs the gate and never touches relay/cleanup bookkeeping.

///     terminator (Claude `result` / `system{turn_duration|stop_hook_summary}`;
///     Codex `turn.completed`) AND the runtime is back at Idle.
///
/// DEFECT 1 (codex #3951): the terminal signal is the finalize-safe
/// [`jsonl_turn_end_terminator_idle`] — the SAME turn-END-only probe the
/// `TurnFinalizer` Done decision uses — NOT the lenient
/// `observe_provider_jsonl_turn_state` idle-queue-drain readiness probe. The
/// lenient probe treats the whole "Idle-class" family as at-rest (Codex
/// `session_meta`/`thread.started`/`event_msg{task_complete}`/a *completed*
/// `agent_message`; Claude `system{init}`; and — via the walk-back fallback —
/// a malformed/torn tail that resolves to a PRIOR `result`). A finalize on any
/// of those over-finalizes a quiet STILL-RUNNING turn (the #2161 premature-
/// completion class). The turn-END-only probe walks PAST every non-terminator
/// Idle-class marker to the real per-turn terminator beneath, and reports Busy
/// (→ `false` here) for a torn/active/unparseable trailing line — so this never
/// finalizes a pane that could still be producing output. No lenient fallback.
///
/// DEFECT 1b (codex #3951 round-2): the `advanced` guard
/// (`last_offset > turn_start_offset`) proves the current turn wrote SOMETHING
/// but does NOT bind the (unbounded) `jsonl_turn_end_terminator_idle` scan to the
/// current turn. When the current turn has so far written ONLY non-terminator
/// Idle-class envelopes (Codex `item.completed`/`agent_message`; Claude
/// `system{init}`), the scan walks past them and latches a PRIOR turn's
/// terminator below `turn_start_offset` — false-finalizing a still-running turn.
/// The finalizer avoids the same false-bind by pinning the finalize identity at
/// the watcher call site (`pinned_finalize_user_msg_id`'s `< current_offset`
/// test); the reconcile has no such call site, so it OFFSET-SCOPES at the probe
/// level via [`current_turn_wrote_turn_end_terminator`] — additionally requiring
/// the CURRENT turn's byte slice `[turn_start_offset, EOF)` to contain its OWN
/// terminator.
