//! Cross-path recovery helpers (issue #1074).
//!
//! This module collects helpers that the three recovery paths (restart /
//! runtime / manual rebind) all need. It intentionally starts very small —
//! the goal of issue #1074's first landing is to create the SSoT surface and
//! migration target, not to relocate every helper at once.
//!
//! Helpers that live here must be:
//!   - pure or nearly pure (no lifecycle state mutation),
//!   - used by at least two of the three paths, or
//!   - explicitly documented as the canonical owner (e.g. inflight cleanup).
//!
//! See `docs/recovery-paths.md` for the path contract.

use crate::services::provider::ProviderKind;

/// Canonical inflight cleanup entry point for all recovery paths.
///
/// Thin re-export around [`crate::services::discord::clear_inflight_by_tmux_name`]
/// (which in turn delegates to [`crate::services::discord::inflight::clear_inflight_by_tmux_name`]).
///
/// Recovery paths that need to drop an inflight file because a tmux session
/// is gone or being replaced MUST call this wrapper rather than reaching into
/// `std::fs::remove_file` or reimplementing the directory scan. Past
/// duplication of this helper (two copies existed before #1074) is the
/// reason we now centralize.
#[allow(dead_code)] // consumed by future recovery::{restart,runtime,manual_rebind} modules
