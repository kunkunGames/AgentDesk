//! #5951 S1 — the `GuardedSaveOutcome` truth table and its behaviour proof.
//!
//! Design §3.3 names six causes that the pre-split `IdentityMismatch` collapsed
//! into one value. The split only earns its keep if every one of them is
//! REACHABLE through a real guarded-write entry point and lands on the variant
//! its repair / finalize semantics demand. Nothing below injects an outcome
//! value into a helper: each case seeds a real durable row in a temporary
//! runtime root and drives the shipped writer against it.
