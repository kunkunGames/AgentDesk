///
/// The generation/name triple is raw rather than bucketed because §9-2's transfer

/// removal log (`log_loader_inflight_remove`) carries the same triple by NAME,

/// `Some(N)`/`None` rather than a number, and adds `age_secs` that the allow
/// side has no equivalent for. The tmux item is NOT one of the differences —
/// the removal log derives the same bool under the same
/// `tmux_session_name_present` spelling (#5462 S5 r3 correction). The site that
/// publishes the raw string `tmux_session_name` is the loader's REFUSAL WARN,
/// `record_loader_generation_gate` above, which is the stream this event is
/// actually the counterpart of.
///
/// A fourth difference runs the other way, so "the same triple by NAME" does not
/// cover it: `current_generation_row`, the derived fence bool below, exists on
/// the allow event alone — neither the removal log nor the refusal WARN carries
/// it, and both would have to recompute it from their generation pair. Joining
/// any two of these streams needs those normalizations first.
///
/// One more asymmetry, this time in the reconcile allow event rather than here
/// (#5462 S5 r4): its `born_generation` and `generation_relation` are spelled
/// WITHOUT the `snapshot_` prefix that its own refusal payload gives stale
/// caller fields, yet both are derived from that caller snapshot and not from a
/// locked re-read — only its `current_generation_nonzero` comes from the epoch.
/// Every generation field on THIS event instead comes off the row this fence
/// just read under its own lock. That site also counts rows this one never
/// could: its `Delegated(GuardedClearOutcome::Missing)` arm stamps a bucket even
/// when the state file could not be read or could not be parsed, so the row it
