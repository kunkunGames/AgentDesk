//! #3960 — producer-liveness TOCTOU reclaim for orphaned `SessionBoundRelay`
//! TUI-direct rows.
//!
//! #3876 (PR #3953) gates the `SessionBoundRelay` owner stamp on a LIVE
//! per-session relay producer existing AT CLAIM time
//! (`tui_prompt_relay::synthetic_start::claim_tui_direct_synthetic_turn`,
//! `global_relay_producer_registry().get_producer(session).is_some()`). The
//! producer can deregister / die in the window between that claim and the
//! terminal commit/ACK. In that window the row stays owned by
//! `SessionBoundRelay`, so [`super::ownerless_external_input_inflight_is_stale_at`]
//! — which requires `owner == None` — never reclaims it; yet no producer feeds
//! the supervisor StreamRelay, the watcher yields to the dead owner, and the
//! bridge tail is off → the TUI-direct answer black-holes (#3960, the #3876
//! residual deferred from PR #3953).
//!
//! This module closes the residual by RE-CHECKING producer liveness + the
//! delivery authority at the idle-relay tick (not just at claim time) and, when
//! the caller has proven the live producer is gone AND the committed-offset
//! authority covers nothing of this turn's body, downgrading the relay owner
//! back to `None` — the SAME bridge-adapter backstop state #3876 stamps when no
//! producer exists at claim. The row then rejoins the ownerless-recovery
//! population and its uncommitted suffix is re-delivered.
//!
//! WHERE THE NO-DOUBLE-RELAY GUARANTEE LIVES — the SEND-POINT committed re-gate,
//! NOT this in-lock shape re-check. The real `SessionBoundRelay` TUI-direct
//! terminal route (`session_relay_sink.rs:1066-1124`, `advance_after_confirmed_post`
//! at :1116) advances ONLY the shared `relay_coord.confirmed_end_offset`
//! watermark and writes NOTHING to the inflight row (no
//! `current_msg_id`/`response_sent_offset`/`full_response`/`terminal_delivery_committed`).
//! So a delivered-but-unmirrored row STAYS orphan-shaped under the flock and the
//! downgrade PROCEEDS — that is expected and correct. Single delivery is then
//! guaranteed because EVERY re-delivery path re-reads `effective_committed_offset`
//! FRESH and `idle_relay_range_action` returns `SkipAlreadyRelayed` (whole body
//! already past the watermark) or `SendSuffixFrom(committed)` (only the
//! uncommitted tail). The caller's unlocked `committed <= turn_floor` gate is a
//! first-line filter for the already-advanced case; the send-point re-gate is
//! the authority.
//!
//! What the in-lock re-check (and the identity/lifecycle guards) DO catch:
//! row-MUTATING in-window commits — the watcher terminal-commit route
//! (`commit_watcher_terminal_delivery_locked`) sets
//! `terminal_delivery_committed`/`full_response`/`response_sent_offset` ON the
//! row, so a watcher commit landing between the candidate scan and this flock is
//! detected (shape no longer matches → abort) — plus a fresh turn B that
//! replaced the orphan (identity guard) and a pinned restart/rebind lifecycle.
