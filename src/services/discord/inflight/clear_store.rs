//! Inflight store-side CAS "clear" + abandon cluster (#3835 extraction).
//!
//! The compare-and-set clear / abandon half of the inflight sidecar contract:
//! unconditional clears, identity-guarded clears (incl. rebind-origin and
//! after-delivery variants), zero-owned clears, the abandon-request enqueue
//! path, and the `response_sent_offset` refresh + normalization helper. Moved
//! verbatim out of `inflight.rs`; the parent re-exports every public symbol at
//! its original visibility so `inflight::*` flat paths stay byte-identical.
//! `normalize_response_sent_offset` is re-imported (non-test) by the parent
//! because the `watcher_state` sibling consumes it in production. The `_in_root`
//! explicit-root seams keep `pub(super)` for the parent's test re-imports.
//! Behaviour-preserving: no function body is altered.
