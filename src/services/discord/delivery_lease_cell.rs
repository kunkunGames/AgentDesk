// #3041 §2-§3 — Delivery-lease `DeliveryLeaseCell` state machine.
//
// As of P1-1 the WATCHER terminal-delivery path wires this LIVE: the watcher
// acquires the cell before sending, heartbeat-renews it during the send, and
// commits+advances+releases INLINE. The `relay_slot` field above is LEFT
// UNTOUCHED for now (its guard migration is a later step). The SINK/BRIDGE
// committers (P1-2) and the 3-way ACK reconciliation (P1-3) are not wired yet,
// so the actor `CommitDelivery`/`ReleaseDelivery` messages and some helpers
// remain dormant — those still carry targeted `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes
// tagged with this issue/phase, to be wired/removed by the follow-up phases.
//
// Design (faithful to #3041 §2-§3):
//   lease = (delivery_lease_key, byte_range [start,end))
//           → a "one-time terminal-delivery right".
//   The lease key is deliberately separate from the finalizer's `TurnKey`: the
//   finalizer keeps its id-0 channel-collapse semantics, while delivery leasing
//   needs id-0 turns disambiguated by their inflight start identity.
//   State machine:
//     Unleased --(CAS acquire)--> Leased{holder, deadline, range}
//               --(commit)-------> Committed{Delivered|NotDelivered|Unknown}
//               --(release)------> Unleased
//     deadline reclaim: Leased --(deadline elapsed)--> Unleased
