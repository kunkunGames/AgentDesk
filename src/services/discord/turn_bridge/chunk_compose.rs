/// `append_streamed_text_chunk` keys off (a `\n\n` suffix), so the two helpers
/// are the matched pair that composes `text → tool → text` into a single
/// separator. Extracting the ToolUse side into its own primitive lets the
/// regression test drive the *real* boundary instead of hand-rolling it, so a
/// logic regression in either primitive is caught.
///
/// Caller keeps the surrounding `inflight_state` / `state_dirty` side effects
/// inline — this helper is pure string composition only (no relay/watcher/
/// ownership state, per the #3016 hot-file constraint). No-op on an empty body.
///
/// #5938: this site both SHRINKS and grows the body — `truncate` drops a
/// trailing whitespace run, then one `"\n\n"` goes back on — and
/// `stream_loop/tool_arms.rs` copies the result straight into the durable row on
/// the next statement, so it mutates exactly the body the telemetry exists to
/// track. Leaving it unobserved put an unexplained `after_len=N` →
/// `before_len=N-2` step into the record stream, which reads as loss. The
/// pre-image is cloned rather than reconstructed because the retained prefix is
/// NOT always `trimmed.len()`: a body already ending in `"\n\n"` is rewritten
/// to itself, and the honest record for that is `prefix_len == after_len`, not a
/// two-byte delta. One clone per `ToolUse` is not a streaming-tick cost.
