/// one assignment and never appends at all.
///
/// The record is taken BEFORE the assignment so `before`/`after` are the real
/// pair, and the assignment that follows is byte-for-byte the one this site has
/// always performed — `String::clone_from` is `clear` + `extend_from_slice` on
/// the inner `Vec`, which is what these two lines do. Nothing is gated on the
/// record; the adoption always happens.
///
/// EXCEPT the no-op. `stream_tick`'s `stage_tick_state_for_guard!` pushes the
/// bridge-local body INTO the row (`inflight_state.full_response.clone_from(
/// &full_response)`) immediately before the guarded save, and on success this
/// function reads that same row back — so the overwhelming majority of adoptions
/// assign a string to itself. Recording them costs a whole-body SHA-256 plus a
/// full prefix scan per tick and emits `before_len == after_len`,
/// `prefix_len == after_len`, `delta_sha8 = e3b0c442` (the empty-string digest),
/// which is precisely the shape an analyst has to filter back out. An equal
/// body is not a mutation, so it is not recorded, and because `clear` +
/// `push_str(durable)` on an equal `durable` is the identity, skipping the
/// assignment with it changes no observable byte. Signal loss is zero: any
/// adoption that actually changes the body still emits.
///
/// #5938 r2 P0-1: `site` is a parameter because this adoption has TWO production
/// callers, not one. `reconcile_runtime_locals_from_inflight_state` below is the
/// `stream_tick` side; `stream_loop::tool_arms::authority::
/// reconcile_tool_arm_locals_after_guarded_save` is the tool-arm side, which ran
/// the identical `full_response.clone_from(&inflight_state.full_response)` with
/// no record at all. Routing both through this one function means the no-op skip
/// and its rationale cannot diverge between them, while the distinct `site`
/// keeps the readout able to say WHICH fence carried the durable bytes in.
/// #5938 r3 P0-2: record the BIRTH of the bridge-local body.
///
/// `turn_bridge/mod.rs` seeds its `full_response` local from
/// `TurnBridgeContext.full_response`, and two of the five production
/// constructions of that context fill it from a durable inflight row —
/// `recovery_engine/restore_inflight.rs` on restart recovery and
/// `tui_prompt_relay/claude_idle_bridge.rs` on TUI-direct idle continuation.
/// Those are durable-row adoptions that happen BEFORE the bridge task exists, so
/// nothing downstream can report them: [`adopt_full_response_from_inflight_row`]
/// skips `local == durable`, which means the first reconcile after such a seed
/// is structurally guaranteed to be silent, and the watcher bytes already in the
/// row would never appear in the readout at all.
///
/// Called from `turn_bridge/mod.rs` as a ONE-LINE replacement for the former
/// `bridge.full_response.clone()`, because that file sits at its 968-line
/// `scripts/hotfile_ratchet.toml` ceiling and this PR does not raise caps.
///
/// An empty seed is not an adoption — it is what the other three construction
/// sites pass — so it emits nothing, mirroring the no-op skip above.
///
/// MEASURED COVERAGE GAP, recorded here rather than left to be discovered: a
/// mutant that reverts the `turn_bridge/mod.rs` call site back to
/// `bridge.full_response.clone()` SURVIVES the suite (round-3 mutant MS-H,
/// rc=0). The body of this function is covered — deleting its
/// `observe_body_mutation` is killed by
/// `seeding_the_bridge_local_body_from_a_durable_row_is_recorded` — but the
/// one-line call that reaches it is not, because the only thing that executes it
/// is `spawn_turn_bridge` itself and no unit test stands that up. Killing MS-H
/// needs either an end-to-end bridge drive or a newtype on
/// `TurnBridgeContext.full_response` that makes the bare clone fail to compile;
/// the latter touches all five construction sites across four files and was
/// judged too wide a blast radius for this PR. Consistent with this module's
