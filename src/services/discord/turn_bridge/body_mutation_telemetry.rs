//! #5938 body-mutation telemetry — OBSERVATION ONLY. See #5938 for the
//! watcher/bridge double-write mechanism this exists to fingerprint.
//!
//! This module records and never intervenes. It does not block an append,
//! does not block an assignment, and does not change a merge rule. Blocking
//! here would swallow legitimately repeated model text and manufacture a fresh
//! #5941-class silent loss.
//!
//! Every mutation site emits the SAME record shape. A single `delta_sha8`
//! appearing under two different `site` values inside one turn pins the double
//! write immediately — that identification is the whole point of the record.
//!
//! COVERAGE — WHAT IS RECORDED, AND AN EXPLICIT REFUSAL TO CLAIM COMPLETENESS.
//!
//! READ THE ABSENCE OF A RECORD AS "NO RECORD", NEVER AS "NO MUTATION."
//!
//! This wording is deliberate: two prior revisions of this module each claimed
//! the recorded sites were exhaustive, and review found a counterexample both
//! times (#5953). So this module no longer makes a completeness claim, in any
//! form.
//!
//! Concretely, for anyone reading a per-turn readout:
//!   * A record means that site ran and these bytes moved. Trust it.
//!   * NO record does NOT mean the body was untouched. An unexplained step
//!     between one record's `after_len` and the next record's `before_len` is
//!     evidence of an unrecorded mutation, and the right response is to go find
//!     which site did it and add it here — not to conclude nothing happened.
//!   * In particular, "no class-1 record this turn" is NOT evidence of
//!     bridge-first. It is the absence of evidence either way.
//!
//! See [`BodyMutationSite`]'s variants for why each recorded site was chosen —
//! that is a rationale for inclusion, not a partition of the surface.
//!
//! KNOWN UNRECORDED SITES, as of this writing and WITHOUT any claim that the
//! list is exhaustive: the two `ProviderErrorPresentation` guidance
//! replacements in `stream_loop/content_arms.rs`; API_FRICTION marker
//! stripping in `post_loop_finalize.rs` and in
//! `terminal_outcome_delivery/empty_response_recovery/handler.rs`; the
//! `CLAUDE_TUI_FOLLOWUP_REQUEUE_DELIVERY_NOTICE` constant in
//! `post_loop_finalize.rs`; the `String::new()` suppressions in
//! `terminal_outcome_delivery.rs`, `handler.rs` (three) and
//! `terminal_outcome_delivery/recovery_retry.rs`; and
//! `prompt_too_long_guidance::render_for_requester` in
//! `terminal_outcome_delivery/cancel_prompt_replace.rs`. The WATCHER's own
//! accumulator in `tmux_watcher.rs` is also not instrumented here.

/// KNOWN FALSE POSITIVES — measured, not hypothetical, and deliberately left in.

/// code line (`    let x = compute_value(input);` × 2, 67 B), one repeated
/// bullet (`- 로그를 확인한다` × 2, 49 B), one repeated table row
/// (`| id | name | status |` × 2, 45 B), and a deliberately repeated emphasis

/// healthy. They stay because every filter that would exclude them — a
/// line-count floor, a "halves must differ in punctuation" rule, a longer
/// minimum — also excludes the short Korean acknowledgement that
/// [`SELF_DUPLICATION_MIN_LEN`] was lowered to 16 to catch, and that class is
/// this deployment's modal turn. The asymmetry is deliberate and the direction
/// is chosen: this is OBSERVATION ONLY (no delivery gate anywhere in
/// `record_invariant_check`), so a false positive costs one ERROR line plus one
/// `guard_fires` tick, while a false negative costs the investigation the
/// module exists for. `known_false_positive_shapes_are_pinned_not_filtered`
/// holds the four shapes so the cost stays a documented number instead of a
