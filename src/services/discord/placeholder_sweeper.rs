//! #1115 placeholder stall sweeper.
//!
//! Background safety net for the case where neither the in-stream lifecycle
//! finalization (#1113) nor the in-band terminal status edits ever fire —
//! e.g. the bridge process is stuck on an external IPC, the JSONL file
//! rotates out from under the parser, or the source Claude Code session is
//! killed without emitting a terminal event. The sweeper periodically scans
//! every persisted inflight state per provider; for placeholders whose
//! `updated_at` has not advanced in a configurable window, it edits the
//! Discord message into a "stalled" or "abandoned" state and (when
//! abandoning) clears the inflight state file so the message is not
//! re-processed by the regular cleanup race.
//!
//! Scope notes for the initial landing:
//! - AgentDesk-tracked inflight states only. Operator-level Claude Code
//!   sessions that never wrote an inflight state file are out of scope and
//!   tracked as a follow-up to the #1112 epic.
//! - Process-alive (`pid` / session close) detection is similarly deferred.
//!   Time-based staleness is the v1 trigger.
