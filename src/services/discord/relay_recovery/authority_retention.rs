//! #5464 (#5071 T5) A7 — retention for the shared relay-authority observation
//! sink, `<agentdesk root>/relay_authority/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`.
//!
//! **Two axes cohabit one file, so the retention unit is the WHOLE FILE.**
//! Axis A's lifecycle records ([`super::authority_observation::append_jsonl`])
//! are the only ones still appended, at
//! `agentdesk_root()/relay_authority/{Local today}.jsonl`. Axis B's
//! structural/reachability candidate records shared that exact path until their
//! writer was retired, so every archived file still carries both. Measured on the
//! live release sink on 2026-09-11, every one of the 8 files carried both
//! schemas (2026-09-07 alone: 1127 `relay_authority.axis_a.v3` lines and 1326
//! `relay_authority.axis_b.v1` lines). Nothing here ever rewrites, truncates or
//! line-filters a file: dropping "expired" lines out of a live file would delete
//! one axis's records out from under the other, and neither axis can be
//! reconstructed from the other's. A file is kept whole or removed whole.
//!
//! The inventory booked this as the one S2 item that lands on *operations*
//! rather than T6 teardown — "JSONL 이벤트 로그에 보존 정책이 없다 … 그 이상은
//! 무한 누적" (`docs/agent-maintenance/t5-t6-removal-inventory.md` §S2, design
//! §5.4 / §8 L-8). This module is that missing owner.

/// Days of daily sink files to keep, counted from today's publish day.

/// **Floor comes from the promotion script, which this lane only reads.**
/// `scripts/relay_authority_rollout_report.py` promotes on ONE segment and
/// requires `WINDOW_DAY_FLOOR = 7` distinct observation days inside it, while
/// `SEGMENT_GAP_HOURS = 48` ends a segment at a gap of 48h or more. Consecutive
/// sample days inside one segment may therefore sit up to two calendar days
/// apart, so a *minimal* qualifying 7-day segment can span
/// `1 + 6 * 2 = 13` calendar days — not 7. Retention shorter than that can
/// delete the older half of a window the operator is still accumulating, which
/// is the one failure this policy exists to prevent.
///
/// Two further reasons the floor is not the ceiling:
///
/// * Daily files are named by **publish** day, not observation day, and a turn
///   stranded without a successor is published "hours or days later" (that
///   script's module docstring, and `authority_observation`'s). A file must
///   outlive the observations it carries.
/// * Stage 2 promotion needs `STAGE_TURN_FLOOR[2] = 500` turns against stage
///   1's 200, which accumulates over correspondingly more calendar days.
///
/// 30 days is ~2.3x the 13-day worst case and bounds the sink instead of
/// letting it grow forever: the live sink measured ~0.47 MB/day (3.3 MB over 7
/// days on 2026-09-11), so the steady state settles near 14 MB.
