//! Discord text-command risk policy (see issue #1005).
//!
//! Commands are classified into risk tiers. High-risk tiers (shell execution,
//! tool grants, runtime control) are gated behind owner identity and — for the
//! most dangerous ones — an explicit opt-in. The goal is to keep
//! `allow_all_users=true` usable for ordinary chat while preventing non-owners
//! from pivoting the bot into a remote shell or runtime kill switch.
//!
//! Surface:
//! - `CommandRisk` — enum of tiers.
//! - `command_risk` — `(command, arg1) → CommandRisk` lookup.
//! - `PolicyDecision` / `evaluate_policy` — authorization outcome helpers.
//! - `high_risk_enabled_via_env` — explicit opt-in via
//!   `AGENTDESK_DISCORD_HIGH_RISK_ENABLED=1`.
//! - `risk_tier_summary_for_help` — string surface for `!help` output.
//!
//! The policy deliberately lives outside `text_commands.rs` so it can be unit
//! tested without standing up Discord wiring.

/// Coarse risk tier for a Discord text command.
///

/// `ReadOnly < Mutating < ShellOrToolGrant < CredentialSystem`.
