//! #3303 — deferred-claim (`origin == DeferredClaim`) marker logic.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//! When a deferred synthetic turn-start CLAIM succeeds
//! (`tui_direct_pending_start::run_worker`, `claimed == true`), the normal
//! `⏳ → ✅` flip is owned by the watcher relay's terminal commit path for the
//! synthetic turn. The observed #3303 failure modes break that ownership:
//! the commit pass never runs for the synthetic turn (the claim seeded the
//! relay cursor at EOF after a prior drain already consumed the response
//! bytes), or the relay fails and a watchdog clears the inflight row without
//! any terminal commit. Either way the anchor's `⏳` was ETERNAL — no
//! reconciler owned it.
//!
//! ## Mechanism
//! The worker records a [`MarkerOrigin::DeferredClaim`] marker (BEFORE it
//! deletes the durable pending-start record, so a crash in between re-records
//! idempotently on the restart re-claim) pinning its OWN synthetic turn
//! identity: `user_msg_id == anchor_message_id` plus the freshly-claimed
//! row's `started_at`. The existing reconcilers then converge it:
//!
//! * the watcher chokepoint's terminal-commit drain covers it when the OWN
//!   turn commits (`⏳ → ✅` — the happy path adds one idempotent, flock-
//!   serialized reaction attempt next to the normal G3 completion);
//! * the sweep's [`decide_deferred_claim_marker_disposition`] bounds the
//!   never-committed case with the TTL `⚠` (the observed bug modes converge
//!   to a bounded `⚠` instead of an eternal `⏳`).
//!
//! ## What it deliberately does NOT do (#3303 adversarial self-checks)
//! * **SC1 — never pin/cover the FOREIGN prior turn**: at the claim instant
//!   the prior turn's commit tombstone is definitionally already durable
//!   (the claim ran right after the prior finalize), so a foreign pin would
//!   stamp `covered` immediately and false-`✅` a still-streaming unanswered
//!   turn. Mode-1 samples (the response already relayed under the PRIOR
//!   turn's relay) therefore converge to the bounded `⚠`, not `✅` —
//!   safety > accuracy, by design.
//! * **No hard cap while the pinned OWN row is live**: unlike the Abort kind,
//!   the pinned identity here cannot churn (one row per `(provider,
//!   channel)`, and the identity IS this row) — the hold ends naturally with
//!   the row's commit/clear/watchdog, so a 1h+ streaming own turn is never
//!   false-`⚠`'d (the r1-finding-2 eternal-hold risk does not apply).
//! * **No hold for name-only successor rows**: once the own row is gone no
//!   later commit can ever cover this marker, so holding for a same-session
//!   successor would only delay the bounded `⚠`.
