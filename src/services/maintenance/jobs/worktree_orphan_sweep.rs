//! `storage.worktree_orphan_sweep` — hourly detection and cleanup of orphaned
//! git worktree directories under `~/.adk/release/worktrees/`.
//!
//! A directory is considered an orphan when NO row in `task_dispatches` with
//! `status IN ('pending', 'dispatched')` has an associated `sessions.cwd`
//! matching the directory path (either exactly or as a path prefix).
//!
//! For each orphan:
//!   1. Attempt `git worktree remove --force <path>` (from the parent repo).
//!      This is a no-op if the dir isn't actually a registered worktree.
//!   2. If the directory still exists, `std::fs::remove_dir_all` it.
//!
//! Fail-closed by design — it would rather leak an orphan than risk deleting a
//! live worktree:
//!   * when Postgres is not wired up it returns `Ok(())` (no DB keep-set, no
//!     deletes); and
//!   * when the tmux query FAILS (#3216 P0-1) it skips ALL deletions for the
//!     run, because a failed query cannot prove a worktree has no live owner.
//!     Only a SUCCESSFUL tmux query (even one with zero panes) lets the sweep
//!     proceed.
